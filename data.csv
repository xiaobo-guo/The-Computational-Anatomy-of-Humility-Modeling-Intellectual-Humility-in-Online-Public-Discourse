AMA.","I am a Pagan, an √Åsatr√∫ar. I follow Odin, Loki, Thor, Freya, Frigg, Tyr, and many other gods and goddesses. They are called the Aesir and Vanir. I have been of this faith for a little over two years now, converted by my husband. Before that, I didn't really label myself. I've always known that something is out there, and had moments where I have felt the Gods presence around me.  I believe my Gods &amp; Goddesses were once real people, who did great things. Thus were immortalized in the ancient Norse ""myths"". I do not believe the Gods to be omnipotent or anything of the sort, but I do believe they have influence over their ""aspects"". For example, Freya is the Goddess of Fertility(among other things), so if you were to pray to her and build her an altar, she would have the power from Valhalla to influence your chances of being fertile or becoming pregnant. Could also go for if you were attempting to have a garden, she could influence the fertility and growth of the garden.   Please, ask me anything. :)",For what purpose would someone invoke or pray to Loki? My knowledge of √Åsatr√∫ar is limited to some of what i have read on wiki and basic stories i have heard.,"There really is no purpose in praying to him. He is the God of mischief, but one may curse him for misdeeds that have happened to them in life.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/humanism.jsonl,humanism.jsonl,h8bszo,Designing a humanistic/artistic community death ritual,"I have a very strong interest in the emerging ""alternative death"" counterculture - the activists, designers, academics and artists who are challenging all the 20th century models of death, from new forms of funeral and memorial to disposition, euthanasia, the philosophical implications of mortality and so-on.  As a rational humanist I'm also deeply interested in new forms of ritual as art-forms, inspired by science and poetic symbolism rather than by supernaturalist assumptions about how the world actually works.  The moral message I want to convey is that since individual human lives are important and death is final, it makes sense to seize the day; to live meaningful lives, to leave behind meaningful legacies and to honor those who have already passed on.  I'm currently designing a modestly-scaled community memorial ritual/celebration based on that ethic.  The design so far is low-tech, uncomplicated, fun and - I hope - moving at the appropriate moments.  It draws some inspiration from the Mexican Dia de Muertos, the European Danse Macabre and similar cultural events, while being very much its own thing in terms of structure and aesthetics.  The loose plan is that - once the COVID-19 situation is manageable, whenever that may be - I'll organize (and thoroughly document) a pilot event to serve as a model for future ceremonies.   My current challenge is to find forums, individuals - basically anyone! - with whom to bounce ideas on this subject.  Any suggestions will be very gratefully received.","I like the idea.  I don't know if I'd be a person to bounce any ideas off of exactly.  But when I die, I would hope that friends, family, whoever might come together and grill up some food.  The whole, dressing up and balling your eyes out watching everyone die of boredom has never appealed to me.  I would rather people bring a varied selection of beer and coffee as well as doing a  potluck that would do me proud.      However, I know that's not what would happen.  My family would make it about them.  Whatever, I'll be dead they can do whatever.  So long as I die in a manner that my organs can be harvested (registered organ donor) and I can help some people, i'll die happy.","I actually walked past a co-op funeral care building recently that had a sign up saying 'Considering a funeral without religion' or something along those lines. Two pensioners looked absolutely horrified, but it's something definitely on the rise thankfully. All the funerals I've been to have been for people who never went to church and one Catholic priest went really off into a speech about making the right choices in life to make sure yoy get into the afterlife... a few annoyed and uncomfortable side glances from some of the mourners there. Though it was a church so don't know what they expected.  My partner told me of the outrage people had in one town when it was suggested they could use the energy created from cremations to heat the local swimming pool. Personally I think this would be a great idea, but then I did laugh on the way to my Gran's funeral as the signpost for the Crematorium was below the one for the Local Dump.  I would suggest checking out the artist Grayson Perry's show Rites of Passage where he explored death rituals from across the world and how people cope with grief.

Dawkins is quoted saying   &gt;The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.     Dawkins holds that there is no purpose, but when asked about the meaning of life he believes life has no meaning other than what you give it. If life has no meaning yet you make up a meaning wouldn't that be delusion? Dawkins refers to the God delusion, but if he is living consistently within his own world view wouldn't the value of his pursuit of atheism also be a delusion?

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/DebateReligion.jsonl,DebateReligion.jsonl,gzt284,Leviticus 18:22 isn‚Äôt about homosexuality (see disclaimer and trigger warning),"Disclaimer: this isn‚Äôt to debate whether or not homosexuality is sinful. Also please refrain from referring to the Greek/Hebrew/Aramaic unless you have credible sources to cite.  ‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER WARNING: rape will be mentioned.  Lengthy post but, please give it a read.  I‚Äôd like to ask a question , present my opinion and receive your (scripture supported) input . There is much that I don‚Äôt know, so I‚Äôm open and excited to see what I might learn from all of you :)   This is a question regarding to the wording used in Lev 18:22 compared to others.   Leviticus 18:22 is a well-known verse, ‚Äúman shall not lie with man‚Äù.  The structure of this verse changes completely from the previous verses against incest. Many of the older versions have the preceding incest verses using ‚Äúdo not uncover the nakedness of‚Äù. Here is a [link with some examples](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/18/Leviticus-18-18.html) of different wording among the versions. I found that the newer versions translated that verse to ‚Äúhave sex with‚Äù whereas the older versions kept the ‚Äúuncover nakedness‚Äù/‚Äúlie with‚Äù wordings, such as the [ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/English-Standard-Version-ESV-Bible/) which was a revision of the [RSV which was a revision of the KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Revised-Standard-Version-RSV-Bible/) . And of course there are different versions of the ESV where it uses ‚Äúuncover the nakedness of‚Äù in v19 but ‚Äúlie with‚Äù in v22.  Let‚Äôs assume that the translators took some liberty with the recent versions and for the sake of this argument I‚Äôll be using older versions, Lev 18:19 goes as follows: ‚ÄúYou shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Leviticus‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠18:19‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/lev.18.19.esv  There are many many different ways to say ‚Äúhad sex‚Äù that are shown in the Bible, see the below:  ‚ÄúThe Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Genesis‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠6:4‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/gen.6.4.esv  ‚ÄúAnd they called to Lot, ‚ÄúWhere are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.‚Äù‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Genesis‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠19:5‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/gen.19.5.esv  ‚ÄúThen Judah said to Onan, ‚ÄúGo in to your brother‚Äôs wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.‚Äù‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Genesis‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠38:8‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/gen.38.8.esv  ‚ÄúSamson went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute, and he went in to her.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Judges‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠16:1‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/jdg.16.1.esv  ‚ÄúYou also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the whore.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Ezekiel‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠16:17‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/ezk.16.17.esv  So based off of this (Im sure there are more), there are different ways to say have sex, while consensual or not , and while paid for or not. These are:  ‚Äúcome in to ‚Äú, ‚Äúto know‚Äù, ‚Äúperform the duty of...raise up offspring‚Äù and ‚Äúplay the whore‚Äù.  Note that I realize the Ezekiel verse plainly talks about pleasuring yourself with an object, not an actual person, I included it to show how plain it reads that there is no question about what they did.  Meanwhile, of the verses that i know of, ‚Äúto lie with‚Äù is used when some form of rape occurred, below are to examples:  ‚ÄúCome, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.‚Äù‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Genesis‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠19:32‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/gen.19.32.esv  ‚ÄúBut he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠2 Samuel‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠13:14‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/2sa.13.14.esv  ‚ÄúIf a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her. He may not divorce her all his days.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Deuteronomy‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠22:28-29‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/deu.22.28-29.esv  ‚ÄúWhoever lies with an animal shall be put to death.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Exodus‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠22:19‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/exo.22.19.esv (Imo, animals can‚Äôt give consent, so filing that under rape)  ‚ÄúAnd you shall not lie with any animal and so make yourself unclean with it, neither shall any woman give herself to an animal to lie with it: it is perversion.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Leviticus‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠18:23‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/59/lev.18.23.esv (Sane reasoning as the previous )  I know that there are certain passages, such as Judges 19 where the rape was described as ‚Äúthey knew her‚Äù but, in the verse (24) prior, the man plainly said ‚Äúviolate them and do what seems good to you‚Äù. It‚Äôs one of the more rarely discussed parts of the Bible but as we can clearly deduce she was raped, this seems to be a one-offs of the use of To know.  My position regarding Leviticus 18:22 is based solely on the reading of the English. I believe that that verse forbids a man from raping another man, especially since raping a female doesn‚Äôt seem to be expressly prohibited, as seen in the Deuteronomy verse cited above (use of the words seize, humble and violated clearly indicate rape). What are your thoughts ?  Reminder, not trying to debate the Bible‚Äôs stance on homosexuality at all. I‚Äôm trying to make sure there‚Äôs an accurate reading being done that makes sense and is consistent with the wording used throughout.  **EDIT** Thanks all for your replies ! And thank you to those that provided links! -I feel like what got away from the responses was the fact that I was not attempting to defend homosexuality.  -i shouldve made it more apparent that I was trying to understand the word choice better (sex had been referred to repeatedly in earlier verses of that chapter, why did it change from that verse on?) -I agree that to understand anything, using the Greek/Hebrew/Aramaic (and prayer*) is the best option. But, given the fact that I wasn‚Äôt trying to defend/attack homosexuality, I wanted to keep replies exclusive to it being assumed that the verse was talking about two adult males. I was trying to avoid anyone saying that it was a mistranslation rather, I wanted to understand why these words were selected .","This line of thought has found its way into Jewish discourse as well.  The verse says "" You shall not lie down with a male, **as with a woman**: this is an abomination"".  It seems the verse includes the mention of the woman to compare a standard sexual encounter with a woman to that of a man. If the issue was with rape it would not need to bring the comparison to a woman as it could just say ""Do not lie (rape in your explanation) a male"" and stop there. The verse seems to be referencing the homosexual action and the issue being in the action itself.","I agree that this verse is about homosexuality but we are wrong, in our modern interpretation. The delivery exposes a consequence for an action that is considered a taboo by the Jews. It‚Äôs essentially stating: Look, if you are gay and act on it then people will regard this as taboo. Just keep in mind that you may even be killed, this is a warning more than it is a directive. God is not justifying the murder of gay men but warning them that people may take the law into their own hands. By Paul‚Äôs time, homosexuality was acceptable in the Roman Empire yet there were cultural specifics that go beyond the point of this discussion... what is important is that scripture is not a book on psychology. Paul stated some may have the propensity to be gay and that chastity is really only the pious route you have.",comment_2,"References text from literature,

This will be one of those events we will look back in in a decade as one of the strongest indicators that the church was purposefully moving back towards a hyper-orthodox and hyper-exclusive religion. I mean, the exclusivity of Mormonism never went away. The September 6 was still a Hinckley thing. But the church has spent a couple decades moving away from that kind of behavior...until Nelson and Oaks took over.",comment_1,,Not about religious discourse,,,,,No,0.9694386517

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/OrthodoxChristianity.jsonl,OrthodoxChristianity.jsonl,113fmtu,Spiritual abuse?,"I may have experienced spiritual abuse in the Orthodox Church in an OCA jurisdiction over a decade ago.  It was a parish that had alot of Evangelical converts.  I myself am from a mainline Protestant background, not highly religious.  I struggled with depression for many years.  I took medications of all sorts and engaged in useless CBT maintanence therapies.  In my late 20's I just gave up psychiatric meds as none really helped me, and I began to search for answers in the self-help/human potential movement.  I encountered Buddhist meditation and metaphysics (this was well before the ""Mindfulness"" fad of today), which cured my depression after several months of intense practice.  I had an experience of becoming a different person, a feeling of awakening spiritually.   I considered myself Buddhist for a while, a few years, before I encountered Orthodox Christians online that taught me about the Orthodox faith.   I sought conversion to Orthodoxy because I honestly believed it was true, and later, the only way I knew how to be a Christian.  I was attending Orthodox services for several years intermittently (usually at least a few times a month) as I had difficulty getting to services.  The priest at the parish did not believe my desire to convert had sufficient enthusiasm, so I made even more effort to attend regularly, but to no avail, and he refused to make me a catechumen due to my non-regular attendance, and I suspect, because I asked alot of questions about the teachings of the Church.  After struggling with this, I had a mental breakdown during Lent and ended up in a mental hospital and got diagnosed with autism.  I felt abandoned by God and worthless.  I sought out a therapist who dealt with trauma and stopped attending the Orthodox church.   Even after all this, after a few years I returned to the church because I honestly didn't feel home spiritually in any other place (I attended other churches off and on, such as Episcopalians, but where I live they are mostly conservative Evangelicals).  The priest made me a catechumen officially, finally.  During the intervening time, however, I got a girlfriend and we moved in together (and we have been together ever since).  She was also disabled and we cannot marry for Social Security reasons.   I eventually pressed the priest to accept me into the church through chrismation, and he flatly refused due to the fact I was living with somebody I wasn't married to.  I was heartbroken and moved on.  I found a Lutheran church (ELCA), and after several years attending, was received by a pastor on confession of faith, just in time for the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, and am now officially a Lutheran.  I was lucky because he was a Greek-German American pastor who handled me with alot of sensitivity, and his own grandfather had been Orthodox.  He was able to combine the insights of Luther with an emphasis on a more mystical theology and encouraged the church to revive some more ancient practices and adhere to a deeper understanding of the calendar.  Eventually, however, he got a new call to a congregation in another location.  I had begun to heal emotionally and with change in the church that was happening, it no longer felt real to me, I felt like alot of people in the church were immature and mindlessly conformist, and many had families that were falling apart slowly due to poor mental and physical health.   Worldly politics and fears started to consume some peoples attention, and scandalously, the church council started allowing a ""security team"" to carry weapons into the church, which felt like a profanation to me.   I stopped going to the Lutheran church shortly before COVID happened, and have only really sought re-engagement since.  I started meditating again regularly, and became a spiritual seeker.  Currently I visit a local United Church of Christ congregation where the people are alot healthier than at my Lutheran church, the demographics are alot more broad (there are several people that are black, hispanic, openly gay or lesbian, etc.), but I have trouble relating to the kind of religion presented, as it is very low church Protestant, even if the people take a more active approach to their spiritual lives than many of the Lutherans I have known, having no shortage of good works they do in their community. The pastor is an elderly woman that is very likable and she is usually good at preaching and leading prayer, though the theology presented is liberal Protestantism with an Evangelical emphasis, and not really mystical.  Communion is only celebrated once a month, they have a somewhat confusing and low theology of the sacraments, and it's essentially like a liberal Baptist church with infant baptism.  I also sometimes go back to the Lutheran congregation to visit at the evening service, but things have not improved and I don't know whether to stay and fight to change things or just give up on it altogether.  I believe religion should cause genuine healing, not getting people into psychiatry, whether it's due to abuse or neglect.    I feel like Orthodox Christians did not handle my situation with sensitivity at multiple stages, all the way from people engaging in an atmosphere of proselytism (this seems to be the case with many Exvangelical Orthodox), to being treated with a lack of dignity and sympathy.  I really don't know what to believe anymore, but I am still seeking.   I'm trying to re-engaging with Christianity in some form, but it feels like the relationship with Eastern Orthodoxy is something I cannot shake, and it's not clear how to move forward.   I wish I lived in an area with more religious options, if I lived in a less conservative region of the country I'd probably just seek out Episcopalianism, as some forms of Episcopalianism would probably suit where I am at.  Providing a loving community but also open to mystical approaches to spirituality.","In short you wanted to convert to Orthodox but when it was found you where willingly living in sin with no plans of marriage the priest refused to let you convert so you had a mental breakdown. Since then, you've abandoned the one true faith and engaged in a heretical bastardization of the truth.  You know what the one true faith is. Accept it and live by it.","I don't think this qualifies as ""spiritual abuse"". Maybe your priest could have worked with you a bit more, but with your victim mentality I don't think it would have done much good. A priest can draw a horse to water, but he can't make it drink.",comment_2,"Avoids Challenging Religious Customs,

In my view i would think christians would love to keep these animals safe and not contribute to the onslaught brutal production of meat in this world. Just yesterday i heard my partner listening to an online church zoom call, and the lady said ""God gave us animals so we can eat their delicious meat"" christians love to make a huge deal about homosexuality and abortions but i wonder why they don't make a huge deal about how horrible meat production companies are. The slaughter houses are just like the holocaust for all those innocent animals. I might get many people who disagree but i am genuinely curious why don't christians actually try to oppose the killing of ""Gods"" animals? I would love to see people views on this as i never have heard anyone really bring this question up, at least to my knowledge.  Some of you may say ""well god created bananas can't we not eat that ???"" Well yes you can but I'm talking about living things with feelings and just the insane way these animals are treated in these slaughter houses and yet no one seems to bat an eye in the Christian community.  Edit: i did not know this post would get so much comments but after a few i realized the title on my post was pretty incorrect. Typed it all up in my lunch break. To be more clear i believe eating animals as a Christian doesn't make much sense. I know jesus allowed humans to eat animals after noahs ark. I know he allows some meat to be eaten and others to not. But my main thing is if Noahs ark saved animals why aren't christians more pro animals in a time where slaughter houses are I'm an unprecedented slaughter streak. To further elavborate why did noahs ark save these animals just to be killed in very greuseome ways. It also baffles me that God created animals just to be eaten yet turns around lets them have pain, fear, personalities, conscious etc etc. Why would a moral God allow such thing ? If the christian God was so holy why did he make these animals be able to suffer. Why did he allow for them to be eaten. If he is the cleanest God of all why didn't he make these animals numb to the pain humans are allowed to bring on them ?","COMMENTARY HERE: Comments that purely commentate on the post (e.g. ‚ÄúNice post OP!‚Äù) must be made as replies to the Auto-Moderator!  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/ELINT.jsonl,ELINT.jsonl,2jy3og,Not a question just want some feedback. Here's my explanation why Heaven and the New Earth are concrete physical things. Please critique,"**tldr** The Bible writers always expressed the eternal heaven and earth will be concrete/material/earthly etc. The doctrine of resurrection means the old human bodies that will be resurrected will get replaced with perfect concrete bodies, these bodies need to live somewhere and since concrete bodes must live in a concrete context and God says Christians will be in Heaven forever it follows that eternal Heaven and earth is concrete  ---  ###Some key scriptures  Mark 10 [[biblehub.com]](http://biblehub.com/esv/mark/10.htm) Matthew 19 [[biblehub.com]](http://biblehub.com/esv/matthew/19.htm), hundredfold&gt; &gt;29 Jesus said, ‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 30who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life  John 14 [[biblehub.com]](http://biblehub.com/esv/john/14.htm), dwelling places&gt; &gt;2 In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you  Revelation 21-22 [[biblehub.com]](http://biblehub.com/esv/revelation/21.htm), is filled with material descriptions of the New Earth primarily focused on a city called New Jerusalem and God coming down to earth&gt;   &gt;1Then I saw a new Heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea. 2And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God  1 Corinthians 15 [[biblehub.com]](http://biblehub.com/esv/1_corinthians/15.htm), immortal bodies&gt; &gt;53For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality  Romans 6 [[biblehub.com]](http://biblehub.com/esv/romans/6.htm), resurrection&gt; &gt;5For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his   Romans 8 [[biblehub.com]](http://biblehub.com/esv/romans/8.htm), resurrection body&gt; &gt;23...but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies  ###In my understanding there are two reasons why the eternal Heaven and eternal earth will be material/earthly.One, the language used in the bible. Two, the definition of resurrection  ---  I've drawn these points from Heaven [[amazon.com]](http://www.amazon.com/Heaven-Randy-Alcorn/dp/0842379428) by Randy Alcorn [[en.wikipedia.org]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Alcorn) and the Bible of course  ####language Throughout the bible and especially in the New Testament, Jesus and his followers continually describe the eternal Heaven and earth with material concrete language while they hardly attempt at describing them in ethereal spiritualized terms. Jesus says he's preparing many rooms for his disciples and that his followers will receive land and families in eternal life (see above verses). Also, The language in Revelation is emphatic in describing the eternal Heaven and earth as concrete places. The writer describes Heaven coming down to earth and God dwelling on the earth with people. (many bible academics will tell you the technical meaning of Heaven is God's dwelling place, or God's throne. So, if God's throne is on earth then this means that Heaven is on earth because God's throne is the definition of Heaven). Indeed, if you read the Bible without any secular influence it is clear the writers are anticipating an eternal state that is material concrete and earthly, yes this includes Heaven. You must ""read into"" the Bible to believe the new Heavens and New Earth aren't concrete or material  ####resurrection The doctrine of resurrection is essential to understanding our eternal state. Our resurrection is a central theme in the Bible, topical bible entry [[biblehub.com]](http://biblehub.com/topical/r/resurrection.htm). Christians are constantly told we are to be raised from the dead in resurrection and that our bodies will be resurrected in glory, that we will be resurrected just as Jesus was and that we will be like Jesus.   So, what is resurrection? Here's googles definitions [[google.com]](https://www.google.com/search?q=resurrection+definition&amp;rlz=1CAHPZY_enUS602US602&amp;oq=resurrection+def&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3095j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=resurrect+definition)  &gt; - restore (a dead person) to life &gt; - revive the practice, use, or memory of (something); bring new vigor to  Resurrection has to do with restoring things, to bring them back to original form or a better form. In the case of Jesus he died in a body and since his body was resurrected Jesus returned in a body, the old body was restored/resurrected to a new body. If Jesus was ""resurrected"" without a body would this be called resurrection? No, just by the definition resurrection means his body would have been restored to another one. So if Jesus was resurrected without a body then he was in fact NOT resurrected because there was NO body  Since Christians have been promised many times that we are going to be resurrected just as Jesus was then we can anticipate we will have concrete bodies and we will live in these bodies forever. Since we have concrete bodies it follows they need a concrete place to live, we call this place earth which can also mean the universe (concrete bodies in a spiritual realm cannot exist and cannot make sense). And since these concrete bodies will live forever the universe will also live forever, and since Heaven/God's home is coming down to the New Earth then Heaven will quite literally be on earth FOREVER  ###misconceptions  - There is only one Heaven, but it exists in two states. First, Heaven is in some temporary state at the moment and will not change until the resurrection of the dead (it's kinda funky and we don't really know if it's concrete or not), I'm calling this temporary Heaven (some say this is Sheol, but I haven't deeply researched this and can't really comment on it). Secondly, Heaven will come down to earth after the resurrection of the dead, this is Heaven's eternal state and I'm calling it eternal Heaven - People get confused when Christians ""go to Heaven"" but then we also say Heaven will be concrete. Clarification&gt; at the moment Christians go to Temporary Heaven but eventually they will go to the concrete Heaven. Temporary Heaven and eternal Heaven are not the same.

This sort of move is the biggest departure that anarchist political theory takes from mainstream liberalism: that communities can agree on the features of a future utopia and govern in the present as if you are already free to live that future utopia. Organizing humans with blanket laws forces you to explain the obvious, namely that hateful people suck and should be persuaded to act otherwise if they wish to remain part of a community that is meaningful to them.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/ChristianApologetics.jsonl,ChristianApologetics.jsonl,nxzoxb,William Lane Craig thinks the universe doesn't change?,"I came across an interesting claim made by William Lane Craig in his book *Reasonable Faith* (2008). In chapter 3 on the existence of God, Craig is discussing the Leibnizian Cosmological Argument, the second premise of which is, ""If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God."" [1] In this particular case, Craig is addressing the atheist who rejects this premise in favor of supposing that the explanation of the universe's existence is the universe itself (i.e., the necessity of its own nature), as per the first premise. Any atheist who wants to venture out onto that limb will quickly discover why his peers usually don't.   Anyhow, setting aside the easy response of our modal intuitions, Craig suggests that we do have ""good grounds for thinking that the universe does not exist by a necessity of its own nature"" (109). As he explains (emphasis mine):  &gt;It's easy to conceive of the non-existence of any and all of the objects we observe in the world; indeed, prior to a certain point in the past, when the universe was very dense and very hot, none of them did exist. What about the fundamental particles or the building blocks of matter, like quarks? Well, it's easy to conceive of a world in which all of the fundamental particles composing some macroscopic object were replaced by other quarks. A universe consisting of a totally different collection of quarks, say, seems quite possible. But if that‚Äôs the case, then the universe does not exist by a necessity of its own nature. **For a universe composed of a wholly different collection of quarks is not the same universe as ours. ... If it were composed of a different collection of quarks, then it would be a different universe, not the same universe.** Since quarks are the fundamental building blocks of material objects, one cannot say, as we might say of macroscopic objects, that while they are contingent, the stuff of which they are made is necessary, for there is no further stuff beyond quarks. [2] No atheist will, I think, dare to suggest that some quarks, though looking just like ordinary quarks, have the special occult property of being necessary, so that any universe that exists would have to include them. It‚Äôs all or nothing here. But no one thinks that every quark exists by a necessity of its own nature. It follows that the universe does not exist by a necessity of its own nature either. [3]  It's worth noting that the collection of quarks that made up the universe in the past is different from that which comprises the universe now, as quarks decay (Nave 1999); for example, a *top* quark can decay through the weak interaction into a W-boson and another, lighter quark. So the universe at t^(1) is made up of a certain collection of quarks, and at t^(2) it is comprised of a different collection of quarks, which means it's one universe at t^(1) and a different universe at t^(2). Okay, let's go with that. Are we to understand, then, that Craig thinks the universe is not a continuant?   ""A substance is a continuant that remains the same through change"" Moreland and Craig explain in *Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview* (2003, 217). The very meaningfulness and intelligibility of ""change"" presupposes the sameness of a substance: ""In fact, a change can be understood as the coming or going of a property by a substance at or throughout a period of time. A substance regularly loses old parts, properties, and lower-order capacities and gains new ones. *But the substance itself underlies this change and remains the same through it*"" (ibid.; emphasis mine).   We are talking about the ship of Theseus here (i.e., personal identity), ""a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object"" (Wikipedia, s.v. ""[Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)""). Most of the cells that comprise my human body are replaced every 10 to 15 years. The epithelial cells that line the surface of my stomach are replaced every five days on average; taste buds are replaced every 10 to 14 days; the epidermis or surface layer of the skin, every two to four weeks; red blood cells, four months; liver, just under two years; hair, roughly three years; entire human skeleton, 10 years or so (Wade 2005). And yet, even though the cells that made up my body over 20 years ago are basically all gone, I am not a different person but the same person; I remain the same person throughout this change.  But Craig thinks it's different for the universe: ""If it were composed of a different collection of quarks, then it would be a different universe, not the same universe,"" he said. So this raises an interesting question, at least to me. If Smith is the same person at t^(1) as he is at t^(2), then it can be said that Smith changed (yet remained ""Smith""). However, if the universe at t^(1) is not the same universe at t^(2), then the universe did not change; rather, the former universe went extinct, being replaced by another. In order to say the universe changed, it would have to remain the same universe throughout. So, does Craig think the universe doesn't change?  ___  **Footnotes:**  [1] The Leibnizian Cosmological Argument is given as follows (p. 106): ""(1) Anything that exists has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause. (2) If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God. (3) The universe exists. (4) Therefore, the universe has an explanation of its existence (from 1, 3). (5) Therefore, the explanation of the existence of the universe is God (from 2, 4).""  [2] Quarks are not constituted by anything else *as far as we know* (which can change). They are considered fundamental particles in the Standard Model of physics.  [3] It is possible that I am mistaken but did Craig just commit the fallacy of composition here? ""The fallacy of composition is an informal fallacy that arises when one infers that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole""‚Äîincluding *every* part of the whole. For example, ""No atoms are alive. Therefore, nothing made of atoms is alive"" (Wikipedia, s.v. ""[Fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition)""). Let's assume that no quark exists by a necessity of its own nature. Does it actually follow that the universe does not exist by a necessity of its own nature?  **References:**  Craig, W. L.

Does it actually follow that the universe does not exist by a necessity of its own nature?  The alleged example of this fallacy strikes me as a bit odd as there are plenty of people who reject any essential difference between living and nonliving things. ""Life"" being an arbitrary quality.   Also, I don't think that's comparable to what WLC is arguing. A universe isn't a simple entity. It's composed of smaller and smaller stuff. If what it was made out didn't need to exist, how could the universe be a necessity? What is the universe but what it's made out of?","I think the difficulty arises by focusing on quarks specifically, rather than what they are made of. WLC likely chose quarks because they are fundamental particles, but his point isn't that the quarks themselves don't undergo changes; rather, his point is that for every individual piece of the universe, however you would wish to define them, they are contingent and not necessary. It is easily conceivable that they could be exchanged for a different set. However, if all the pieces of a thing are contingent, not necessary; then to say that the whole is necessary seems to somewhat come out of nowhere.   Necessary in what sense? Why, and how?  If every part of the universe could be replaced, you could conceivably replace the whole universe; and if you could conceivably replace the whole universe, then the universe is not necessary, it is contingent.

The people there were so friendly and accepting. I enjoyed the quiet, it was so peaceful and good for my mind. However I have an issue with fidgeting and if I don't have anything for my hands I pick at my nails. If I manage to refrain from that I end up chewing my lip raw. When I was younger I would draw or weave plastic gimp during church to keep my hands occupied so my mind could be relaxed and focused.   I'm new to this and don't know what's okay and what isn't. I think for sermons it would be acceptable to knit at the churches I grew up at (at least people did and I never heard anyone make an issue about it).  I realized Quakers are accepting and not judgemental people, but I also noticed how quiet and still it was. Some people need that to focus so I don't want to distract by doing something like clacking knitting needles together. I don't know if doing some sort of very simple, small counted cross stitch could be okay? Such as a little square with one thread I make Xs across the whole thing for the methodical feeling my hands would get so that my mind is free to worship without distraction.   I also saw someone with a notebook. Perhaps something like that could work for me.

What would be the significance of deeming it comparable or not? Depending on what one means by today's ""multiculturalism"", I think it's difficult to compare a premodern, effectively stateless tribal context with multiculturalism in the context of modern states.  Of course, the early Muslim polity did start to develop - in an embryonic phase - in Medina and as such, one could perhaps argue that because membership in that Muslim polity was based on a shared comprehensive doctrine instead of tribal identity, lineage, social position it ushered in radical changes in the whole social and political structure of the territory. As such Islam offered a framework to unite - until then continuously warring - tribes under the banner of 'supratribal' (religious) values. By extension, one could argue Islam offered a framework for different 'cultures' to coexist on the basis of values that transcend tribal and cultural affiliations. If it weren't for its ability to accommodate (and adapt to) diverse cultures, Islam wouldn't have become a world religion.  Two critical points I can think of in this respect:   - Despite its early revolutionary impetus, you could argue Islam never managed to shed its tribal origins, witness the dominant view in Sunni Islam - let alone Shi'i Islam - on the necessity of the caliph being of a specific tribal identity (i.e. one of the Quraish).   - I believe there's some historical evidence that in early Islam - in the newly conquered territories outside of the peninsula - the idea of Islam as a truly universal religion where non-Arabs could - and were encouraged to - be and become Muslim on a completely equal footing wasn't well established.","I can elaborate. I guess it comes down to what relations would be like between cities at the time of Muhammad. I'm thinking in terms of ""city-states"", rightly or wrongly.  I find the AH period fascinating when Meccan families moved in with Medinian families (Ansar and...?) and then how after Muhammad's death the fault lines between them are apparent. I think this is your ""never managed to shed tribal origins"" if you want to expand/expound on that I'd find it interesting. Yes, it seems like a radical, and in today's lingo-- progressive-- move on the part of Muhammad having them live together like that-- a grand attempt to transcend clan/tribe/family?

(al-Bukhaari, no. 5787)  This has been interpreted for men whose pants  go beyond their ankles . most of these practices were those common among the mushrikeen in Mecca and were discouraged . Other hadiths from the classical Hadith  can be problematic like believing 6 year olds can get engaged to adult men or 9 year olds are mature for sexual activity.  Believing hadiths is not a pillar of faith and there are even hadiths against hadiths. Written records of the Prophet‚Äôs life were destroyed during the rule of the caliph Umar Ibn al-Khattab.  ‚ÄúUmar ibn al-Khattab once tried to deal with the problem of committing the Hadith to writing. The companions of the Prophet whom he consulted, encouraged him, but he was not quite sure whether he should proceed. One day, moved by God's inspiration, he made up his mind and announced: ""I wanted to have the traditions of the Prophet written down, but I fear that the Book of God might be encroached upon. Hence I shall not permit this to happen."" He, therefore, changed his mind and instructed the Muslims throughout the provinces: ""Whoever has a document bearing a prophetic tradition, shall destroy it."" The Hadith, therefore, continued to be transmitted orally and was not collected and written down until the period of al-Mamun.  The earliest schools and scholars of Islamic law‚Äîstarting around a century and a half after the death of Muhammad‚Äîdid not all agree on the importance of Prophetic sunnah and its basis, the hadith of Muhammad (""hadith of Muhammad"" because in earlier times ""hadith"" could be used to refer to reports of sayings or doings of other early Muslims).  Some (legal pragmatist scholars known as ahl al-ra øy) regarded Prophetic sunnah as only one source of law among many‚Äîother sources being the traditions of other caliphs and of leading early Muslims. Others (speculative theologians were known as ahl al-kalƒÅm) rejected the authority of hadith because they thought there was no way to be absolutely certain about the authenticity of century and a half old reports of Muhammad's words, actions, and silent approval.  Ahl al-Kalam, were ""highly critical of both the traditionists' method and the results of their work"", doubting ""the reliability of the transmission"" of the hadith,including the traditionists' evaluation of the ""qualities of the transmitters"" of hadith they considered ""purely arbitrary"", and thought the collections of hadiths to be ""filled with contradictory, blasphemous, and absurd traditions.‚Äù",comment_2,"Challenges Religious Customs,

I love Islam, it's beautiful but I wasn't in Sunday school or Arabic school long enough to be taught how to pray. I have tried searching the internet and videos on how to pray but they are all different and I'm struggling. I don't even know the small sayings during prostration other than the shahada and 'Allah Akbar'. My mother hasn't been helping me much with this. She has stormed into my room multiple times asking me why I don't pray and I keep telling her that I am trying but I don't know how to. She never took the initiative to even ATTEMPT to help me or teach me and just left me to try learn alone but it's been hard. I want to start praying but the more than she forces it upon me without helping me, the more I feel deterred from Islam, despite being born Muslim. I'm trying my best but my mother isn't being helpful nor is she being supportive in how we can go about this and it's hurtful. She told me that I have to stand behind my brother and father and begin doing all 5 prayers starting from tomorrow instead of helping me build it up slowly.

There is now an abundance of NDE because medicine allows people to be saved from death more than ever, not to mention the many drugs that may induce or facilitate these experiences.  I thought it was just an experience as using LSD or a psychedelic drug, and there seem to be an overlap, but people who experience and NDE claim stuff such as the following:  I noticed these things are often claimed by most people who experienced NDEs during the experience:  - It seems most of them claim to be ""judged"" (for a lack of a better word) by their good deeds and good intentions rather than their beliefs or lack of.  - Most of them would prefer that peace over returning to life, but they are somehow convinced by an entity to return.  - They often meet diseased family members who guide or explain them stuff about the afterlife that they often forgot anyway.  - Most of them claim some kind of ""life review"", where they feel the pain they caused, but also the love they gave. However, there is no punishment, just some guilt and shame that is strong but not lasting. - I find weird most of them claim Heaven have a Greco-Roman style. I think the reason is that often psychedelic experiences are full of fractal patterns and Greco-Roman styles of columns seem to also have a fractal structure. Anther hypothesis is that maybe these experiences inspired Greek style, maybe though psychedelics.  After the experience, they also notice stuff is different:  - Some depressed people claim they finally found the purpose of life and started loving it after their NDE, even being 60 or 70 years old.  - It seems most religious people relax their dogmas, and most non-believers start believing in God but in a very non-dogmatic way.  - Many of them claim to re-negotiate life conditions, which if true, that would imply humans have some leverage on their destiny. For instance, many of them claim to be healed or life-long issues suddenly fixed.  - Most of them claim they are very lucky now and seem to ""attract"" fortune and good things, find love or find a way to make money doing what they love.  Regardless, even if NDEs are delusions, I find it interesting how deep and beautiful the mind can be, and how deep these experiences can be for these people.  Here is a [compilation of these experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1La-8uHbV6Q&amp;list=PLTpFZVpQ7M85G6QSVZJYrloDY8BpBK3CG) for people interested.","Delusions are, by definition, pathological and not remedial or curative. Paranoid fantasies of secret government agents coming to get you is both non-factual and harmful to your life if believed. Spiritual experiences can be non-factual, yet metanoic, so delusion is the wrong word.   I suspect that one of the reasons why psychedelic shamanism has so much therapeutic potential is because in some real sense, it tricks the body into believing it is dying, or rather it is a safe simulation of the process the body goes through in death. Which is why there is so much phenomenological overlap between the experiences of people taking Ayahuasca, say, and people who have had NDEs.","I wonder if inducing these experiences safely may be a viable therapy in the future, and I wonder suppose society would be so much rich and peaceful and loving if NDE is a positive experience for most people.",comment_1,Challenges Religious Customs,Challenges Religious Customs,,,,,No,0.0128676334

Having a written agreement in the format of the following might be helpful:  &gt; * I understand that this is a short-term living arrangement with the purpose of helping me to get settled and on my own in life.  &gt; * I understand that my number one purpose while being here is to learn the skills, and to set up the situations, where I am employed and living on my own.  &gt; * I agree to follow your instructions regarding how to find a job.

You don't vote for someone based on how they act, you vote for someone because you think they are what is best for the country.

[chapters] 1 and 4, and in its present form is clearly from the hand of the writer of those chapters.  Like them, however, it seems to be the working over of an earlier narrative.  There may well have been in circulation popular tales about the last days of Chaldean Babylon and the coming of the Persians, one of which the writer has adapted for his present purpose.   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;In many details the story does not conform to what we know from contemporary sources about the last days of the Neo-Babylonian kingdom.  It makes Belshazzar the son of Nebuchadrezzar and his immediate successor.  Nebuchadrezzar, however, was succeeded by his son Awel-Marduk (the Evil-merodach of II Kings 25:27-30), he by Nergalsharusur, he by Labashi-Marduk, and he by Nab≈´-na‚Äôid (Nabonidus), in whose seventeenth year Babylon was taken by the armies of Cyrus.  Nabonidus was no blood relation of Nebuchadrezzar; his son Bƒìl-shar-u·π£ur was the ruler in charge of Babylon during his father‚Äôs absence at Taima in Arabia, but he was never king, and in contemporary inscriptions appears usually as ‚Äòthe king‚Äôs son.‚Äô  The conqueror of Babylon is here named **Darius the Mede**.  This derives from the writer‚Äôs four-empire theory, which demands a Median between the Babylonian and the Persian empires, though no such Darius is known to history‚Ä¶ His source was in many respects a good one, having many details which show acquaintance with life at an ancient Oriental court... The story seems to regard the Persian conquest of Babylon as something already long past‚Ä¶the story was not written to teach history but a religious lesson from which the audience could draw encouragement.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 418-420)   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;‚ÄúThis chapter is out of its place, and should come in after the *seventh* and *eighth*.  There are difficulties in the *chronology*‚Ä¶ Here there is no mention of *Neriglissar*, nor *Laborosoarchad*: but, as they were *usurpers*, they might have been purposely passed by.‚Äù (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. IV 321)   &amp;nbsp;     -1. And made, the king, *BayL-Shah-‚ÄôTsahR* [Belshazzar], a drink-fest great to a thousand [of] his princes, and set wine as opposite a thousand men [◊ê◊ô◊©, ‚ÄôeeYSh, ‚Äúman‚Äù, singular].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú*Bƒìl-shar-u·π£ur*, ‚ÄòO Bel, protect the king,‚Äô is a late Babylonian name.  The Greek versions confuse it with that of Belteshazzar.  The writer evidently regards him as having been a king in the fullest sense, since he speaks of documents being dated from the year of his accession (7:1; 8:1).  From the inscriptions, however, it is clear that he never ruled, since though he was present in Babylon the annual New Year‚Äôs festival could not be held because the real king, his father, was away in Taima‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;‚Ä¶from vss. [verses] 30-31 it is clear that the occasion was on the eve of the fall of Babylon in 538 B.C.  If we suppose Daniel to have been a youth of sixteen when he was brought into captivity in 605 B.C., he would at this time have been eighty-three years of age, though it is unlikely that the writer would have thought of making this calculation‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;Contemporary inscriptions make it clear that Babylon was captured without a blow and that Nabonidus was presently taken prisoner.  Cyrus‚Äô own inscription suggests that the populace welcomed him with joy.  There was a later tradition, however, that the city was taken by a night attack while the inhabitants were celebrating a fest.  This tradition has left traces both in Herodotus (*History* I. 191) and Xenophon (*Cyropaedia* VII 5. 15-31), and was doubtless in the story utilized in this chapter.  It may have arisen from a transference to the capture of the city of events really belonging to the New Year‚Äôs festival of 539, which Nabonidus seems to have celebrated in the city with the usual rites and with plentiful distribution of wine to the troops.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 420-421)   &amp;nbsp;     -2. And said, BayL-Shah-‚ÄôTsahR, **for good to his heart in wine**, to bring the utensils, the gold and the silver, that had taken, NeBOoKhahDNeh-TsahR [Nebuchadnezzar], **his father**, from the temple that is in Jerusalem, in order [◊õ◊ì◊ô, *KeDaY*] that they drink in them, the king and his princes, and **his wives, and his concubines** [◊ï◊§◊ô◊ú◊í◊©◊ô◊ï, *OoPeeYLGahShaYV*].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**When he tasted the wine**: This is the only place in biblical Aramaic where the verb is used in its literal sense of ‚Äòto taste food or drink.‚Äô‚Ä¶ Most interpreters take the verse to mean ‚Äòwhen the wine began to taste,‚Äô i.e. [in other words], under the influence of wine‚Ä¶ In the Babylonian Talmud [the central text of Rabbinic Judaism and the primary source of Jewish religious law and Jewish theology - Wikipedia](Megillah [""scroll"", a Mishnaic tractate] 11*b*) there is a curious notion that Belshazzar gave the order because of a calculation he had made.  He knew the prophecy of Jeremiah that the Exile would last seventy years, and he calculated that, as Nebuchadrezzar had reigned forty-five years, Evil-meordach twenty-three years, and he himself had been reigning two years, the seventy years of prophecy were now up.  The prophecy had not been fulfilled, the Jews had not gone back, and as the prophecy was a failure and the Jews would never return, there was not further purpose in storing the sacred vessels, which might just as well be brought out and put to use.  This was a wrong calculation, of course, because he began to count his seventy years at the accession of Nebuchadrezzar.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;‚Ä¶An audience in Maccabean times would inevitably be reminded of the outrage of the year 170 B.C. (I Macc. [Maccabees] 1:2-24).   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;**His father**: The writer regards Belshazzar as the son and successor Nebuchadrezzar (vss. [verses] 2, 11, 13, 18, 22)‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;**His wives and his concubines** appear again in vs. 23 and are part of the *d√©cor* of the story.  It was not customary in the ancient East or women to appear at feasts, though Herodotus (op. cit. [the work cited] V. 18) witnesses to it in Persia, and Quintus Curtius (*History of Alexander* V. 1. 38) to its occurrence at Babylon in the time of Alexander.  Vashti was summoned to appear at a feast in Esth. [Esther] 1:11, but that was regarded by her as something unusual‚Ä¶ *ShƒìghƒÅl* [wife] for ‚Äòwife‚Äô or ‚Äòconsort‚Äô is used in Neh. [Nehemiah] 2:6 for the wife of the Persian king, and in Ps. [Psalm] 45:9 for the queen of some Israelite prince.  In later Hebrew it lost its honorable meaning.  *Le·∏•ƒìnƒÅh* [concubine] is the Akkadian *la-a·∏´-na-tu*, ‚Äòa vessel‚Äô (cf. [compare with] œÉŒ∫ŒµœÖŒøœÇ [*skeuos*] in Thess. [Thessalonians] 4:4).  In Song S. [Song of Songs] 6:8 queens and concubines are mentioned together (cf. I Kings 11:3).‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 421-423)   &amp;nbsp;    -3. So [◊ê◊ñ, *‚ÄôahZ*] they brought utensils of the gold that were taken from [the] temple, House [of] the Gods, that is in Jerusalem,    and they drank in them, the king and his princes and his wives and his concubines.    -4. They drank wine and gave praise [◊©◊ë◊ó, *ShayBahH*] to gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone.   &amp;nbsp;    -5. [In the] same hour went out fingers [of] [the] hand of ‚ÄôahDahM [‚Äúman‚Äù, Adam],    and it wrote, opposite [◊û◊ï◊ú, *MOoL*] the lampstand [◊î◊†◊ô◊ë◊®◊©◊™, *HahNeeYBRehShehTh*], upon the plaster [◊î◊ò◊ô◊ó, *HahTeeY-ahH*] that was upon [the] wall [◊õ◊ï◊™◊ú, *KOTheL*] [of] [the] temple [of] the king.  And **saw**, the king, [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh* (*Nota accusative*, a preposition which identifies the direct object of a verb; no English equivalent)] **the palm** [◊§◊°, *Pah√á*] **of the hand** that wrote.    &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú*NebhrashtƒÅ‚Äô* is a lamp or a candelabrum, perhaps a Semitic word derived from the root ◊ë◊®◊® [*BahRahR*], ‚Äòto be clear, bright,‚Äô though some think it is an Iranian word cognate with the Greek ŒªŒ±ŒΩœÄŒ±œÉ [*lampas*].  **Saw the hand as it wrote**: Lit. [literally], ‚Äòsaw the palm of the hand which wrote.‚Äô *Pa·π£* is used both of the palm of a hand and sole of the foot, but since, as Obbink remarks, one cannot see the palm of a hand which is writing, it must here mean **the part of the hand** to which the fingers are attached.‚Äù  (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 421-423)   &amp;nbsp;    -6. So changed [the] **countenance** [◊™◊ï◊ê◊®, *ThO‚ÄôahR*] [of] [the] face of the king,    and **his thoughts terrified him** [◊î◊ë◊î◊ô◊ú◊ï◊î◊ï, *HeeBHeeYLOoHOo*],    [the] joints of [◊§◊ô◊®◊ß◊ô, *PeeYRQaY*] **his loins** [◊ó◊ú◊¶◊ô◊ï, *HahLahTsahYV*] **loosened** [◊î◊ï◊™◊®◊ï, *HOoThROo*], and **his knees** [◊ï◊ë◊®◊õ◊ô◊ï, *OoBahRKahYV*] knocked [◊®◊¢◊ì◊ï, *Rah`ahDOo*].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú*Z»ãw* is the ‚Äòbrightness‚Äô or ‚Äòsplendor of 2:31, a word used in 4:36 of the **countenance** of Nebuchadrezzar, and 7:28 of that of Daniel‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;**His thoughts alarmed him**: The same verb expressive of alarm was used in 4:5, 19 and occurs again here in the queen mother‚Äôs speech in vs. 10‚Ä¶ The Hebrew equivalent in Eccl. [Ecclesiastes] 1:17; 2:22; 4:16 is commonly translated ‚Äòvexation,‚Äô so that we are to think of anxious thought.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;**His limbs gave way**: Lit., **The joints of his loins were loosed**.  *Qe·π≠ar* is properly a ‚Äòknot‚Äô (see vs. 12) and *·∏•ar√ßƒÅ‚Äô* is the lower part of the back, i.e., the **loins**.  The phrase is found in Targ. [Targum] Jon. [Jonathan]^1 on Gen. [Genesis] 50:11, and is used in Hebrew to express panic fear in Ps. [Psalm] 69:23; Nah. [Nahum] 2:10.  Charles compares the Homeric Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ ŒªœÖœÑŒø Œ≥ŒøœÖŒΩŒ±œÑŒ± [*autou luto gounata* ‚Äúher knees knocked‚Äù] (*Odyssey* IV. 703; *Iliad* XXI. 114)‚Ä¶ **His knees knocked together**‚Ä¶ in Nah. 2:20 this is associated with the loosening of the loins.‚Äù  (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 424)   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;I think this is euphemism for ‚Äúhe shat himself‚Äù.   &amp;nbsp;    -7. And called out, the king, in a voice loud, to bring [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the sorcerers [◊î◊ê◊©◊§◊ô◊ù, *Hah‚ÄôahShahPheeYM*], [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the necromancers [◊î◊õ◊©◊ì◊ô◊ù, *HahKahSDeeYM*], and [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the wizards [◊î◊û◊õ◊©◊§◊ô◊ù, *HahMKhahShPheeYM*].    And answered, the king, and said to [the] wise ones of BahBehL,   &amp;nbsp;    ‚ÄúAny who that reads [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the **writing** the this and reveals to me [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] its interpretation [◊§◊©◊®, *PehShehR*] will wear **purple**,    and a **necklace** [◊ï◊¢◊†◊ß, *Ve`ahNahQ*] [of] gold will be set upon his neck [◊¶◊ï◊ê◊®◊ï, *TsahV‚ÄôahRO*], and he will **rule** as my **third** in [the] kingdom.‚Äù   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúHad the writing been in the usual style, it is argued, the wise men could have read it even if they failed to catch its meaning, but this writing was something strange which they could not even read‚Ä¶ The solution in vs. 25 however, apparently depends on the **writing** having been in Aramaic, though it may have been Aramaic written in some strange way or in unfamiliar characters.  It is simplest to assume that the writing itself was intelligible to the wise men, i.e., they could read the characters, but could make no intelligible sense out of them to convey a message to the monarch.  The detail of the reward may have been suggested by Gen. 41: 42-43, where Pharaoh in his delight at the interpretation of the dream clothes Joseph in fine linen, hangs a golden chain about his neck, and makes him ride in the second chariot.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;**Purple**: The word is often and with some justification translated **scarlet**.  It was a sign of royal dignity among the Persians‚Ä¶ the Medes‚Ä¶ certain Greeks‚Ä¶ the Seleucids‚Ä¶ and the Midianites‚Ä¶ whence it came to be regarded as the symbol of royalty‚Ä¶ It probably is not a Semitic word but is borrowed from some pre-Semitic people on the Mediterranean coast among whom was the original seat of the production of this red-purple dye from the local shellfish (see Pliny *Natural History* IX. 60-62).   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;‚Ä¶The word for **chain** is derived from some Iranian source.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;‚Ä¶**Third ruler**: Lit., ‚Äòand third in the kingdom shall he rule,‚Äô a phrase which has given rise to much discussion.  Obviously it is parallel to Joseph‚Äôs being set to ride in the second chariot, but there is no certainty what ◊™◊ú◊™◊ô [*ThahLahTheeY*] here and ◊™◊ú◊™◊ê [*ThahLahThah‚Äò*; both resemble the Arabic word for three, ÿ´ŸÑÿßÿ´ÿ©, *ThaLaTha‚Äô*] mean, save that the words must have some relation to the root for ‚Äòthree.‚Äô‚Ä¶ There was, however, a Babylonian official title *≈°al≈°u*.  The monarch was head of the army, the chief officer was the one ‚Äòon his right,‚Äô the second officer the one ‚Äòon his left,‚Äô and the third officer was the adjutant, the *≈°al≈°u rakbu*.  This would explain the Aramaic form and may be the office meant here.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 424)   &amp;nbsp;    -8. So came all [the] wise ones of the king,    but [◊ê◊ö, *‚ÄôahKh*] they were not able to read [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the writing and tell to [the] king [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] its interpretation.    -9. And **terrified** was, thereby [◊ê◊ñ, *‚ÄôahZ*], the king BayL-Shah-‚ÄôTsahR **until much**;    [the] countenance [of] his face changed, and his princes were confused [◊†◊ë◊ï◊õ◊ï, *NeeBOKhOo*].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**Greatly alarmed**: The same verb is used in vs. 6 and in 4:5, 19, only here in the intensive.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 426)   &amp;nbsp;    -10. To hearing words of the king and his princes, came **the mistress** [◊î◊í◊ë◊ô◊®◊î, *HahGBeeYRaH*] unto [the] house [of] the drink-fest, and answered, the mistress, and said,    ‚ÄúThe king to [the] world will be!    Do not terrify you your thoughts,    and do not change [the] countenance [of] your face.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúThe text has only **queen**, which some have thought refers to this chief consort.  Usually, however, it is taken to mean the queen mother, first because vs. 2 speaks of the wives as being already there, and second because in vs. 11 she speaks to him of his father in a way that suggests a mother speaking to a son rather than a wife to her husband.  Since the writer regards Belshazzar as the son of Nebuchadrezzar, this would be Nebuchadrezzar‚Äôs wife, who would doubtless be regarded with respect by the courtiers.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 426)   &amp;nbsp;     -11. ‚ÄúThere is [◊ô◊©◊†◊ï, *YehShNO*] a man in your kingdom that [has] [the] spirit [of] **gods**-holy in him.  In [the] days [of] your father they found in him the light [◊î◊ê◊®◊î, *Hah‚ÄôoRaH*] and intelligence and wisdom in wisdom of gods,    and the king, NeBOoKhahDNeh-TsahR, your father, stood him to head the magicians [◊î◊ó◊®◊ò◊û◊ô◊ù, *HahHahRTooMeeYM*] and the sorcerers, the necromancers, and the wizards.  Thus did **your father the king**.‚Äù   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúSome have remarked that she speaks as a polytheist, but here, as in 4:8, though **gods** is plural in form, the sense is singular‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;At the end of this verse the M.T. [Masoretic Text, the standard Hebrew Bible] has **the king your father**... but the words are not in the Greek or the Syriac version, nor are they in Josephus; they are probably to be regarded as a scribal addition.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 427)   &amp;nbsp;    -12. For a **spirit of excellence** [◊ô◊™◊®◊î, *YahTheeRaH*], **knowledge** and **intelligence**, ability **to solve dreams**, to **tell secrets**, and to **unravel** [◊ï◊ú◊î◊™◊ô◊®, *OoLeHahTheeYR*] **knots** [◊°◊™◊ï◊û◊ï◊™, *√áeThOoMOTh*] were found in DahNeeYay-‚ÄôL [""My Judge is God"", Daniel].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúDaniel‚Äôs three special skills are enumerated as dream interpretation, riddle solving, and spell breaking, his **excellent spirit** giving him his skill in oneiromancy^2, his **knowledge** enabling him to solve riddles, and his **understanding** serving to break talismans‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶     &gt;‚Äú**To interpret dreams**: in the M.T. the word is pointed as a participle, but to point it as an infinitive is a necessary correction.  Daniel‚Äôs skill in oneiromancy was the subject of chs. 2 and 4.  There were dream books available, but without discernment on the part of the diviner their instructions were not of much use.  It is Daniel‚Äôs insight, as that of Joseph in Gen. 40-41, that is the source of his sill.  **Explain riddles**: *‚ÄôA·∏•»ãhƒÅh* is a thing closed in and concealed.  It is the equivalent of the Hebrew word used for ‚Äòriddle‚Äô in Num. [Numbers] 12:8, for a ‚Äòhard question‚Äô in I Kings 10:1, for a ‚Äòproblem‚Äô in Ps. 49:4.  The word for **solve** is that used in 2:5; et al. [and elsewhere], for ‚Äòdeclaring‚Äô the interpretation of a dream.  It corresponds with the Hebrew phrase in Judg. [Judges] 14:14‚Ä¶ **Solve problems**: Lit., ‚Äòunloose knots.‚Äô  So in vs. 16.  *Qe·π≠ar* is the word that was used in vs. 6 for the fastening of the joints.  In Ezek. [Ezekiel] 46:22 the verb is used for the ‚Äòknotting‚Äô (joining) of corners in building construction.  In later texts the word is used of magical knots, spells, talismans, etc., so that ‚Äòto loose knots‚Äô became a technical term in the vocabulary of the magician‚Äôs art, referring to the rites of spell breaking and exorcism.  In Enoch 8:3 we read of ‚Äòresolving of enchantments‚Äô (cf. 95:4); in Luke 13:16, of the loosing of the woman knotted up by Satan for eighteen years; and in the *Qur‚ÄôƒÅn* [Koran], *S≈´ra* 113:4, Muhammad seeks relief from the women who blow upon knots.  The Syrian church fathers knew of ‚Äòknots‚Äô as a special form of sorcery.  All these are the descendants of the ‚Äòknotting‚Äô of ancient Mesopotamian magic for whose ‚Äòloosing‚Äô there were elaborate techniques‚Ä¶ Other interpreters reject this suggestion of a magical reference and insist that all that is meant is that he had ability in resolving difficulties.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 427-428)   &amp;nbsp;    -13. So they brought  DahNeeYay-‚ÄôL to face the king, and answered, the king, and he said unto DahNeeYay-‚ÄôL,    ‚ÄúSo [◊ï◊ë◊õ◊ü, *OoBKhayN*] you are he, DahNeeYay-‚ÄôL, from [the] sons of exiles of [◊í◊ï◊ú◊ô, *GOLaY*] YeHOo-DaH [""YHVH Knew"", Judah], that brought, my father, from YeHOo-DaH.    -14. I heard that [◊õ◊ô, *KeeY*] a spirit of gods is in you,    and that enlightenment, intelligence, and wisdom are found in you.    -15. And now, behold, were brought to face me wise-ones and magicians in order that they read [◊ê◊™, ‚ÄôehTh] the writing and make known to me its interpretation,    but they are not able to tell to me [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] [the] interpretation [of] the word,    -16. and I heard that able you are to make plain [◊ú◊ë◊ê◊®, *LeBah‚ÄôayR*] interpretations, and to unravel knots.    And now, if you are able to read [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the writing, and to make known to me its interpretation,    you will wear purple, and a necklace gold will be set upon your neck, and as [the] third in my kingdom you will rule.‚Äù    &amp;nbsp;    -17. And answered then, DahNeeYay-‚ÄôL, and he said before the king,    ‚ÄúYour presents keep [◊©◊û◊ï◊®, *ShMOR*] to yourself,    and your gifts [◊ï◊ì◊ï◊®◊ï◊†◊ï◊™◊ô◊ö, *VeDORONOThaYKhah*] give to others,‚Äù   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶ a rhetorical refusal, for in vs. 29 we find him accepting what the king had promised.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 429)   &amp;nbsp;    ‚Äúbut [◊ê◊™, ‚ÄôehTh] the writing I will read to [the] king,    and its interpretation I will tell to him.‚Äù   &amp;nbsp;    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;&gt;&gt;‚ÄúDANIEL‚ÄôS SERMON TO THE KING (5:18-25)‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p.

But most religions follow this general trend.   And I created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).  This is a verse from the Quran. It seems contradictory to me and not the character of a divine entity. He want us to practice humility but is also judging based on who worshipped him and who didn't. The argument that worshipping reminds us of him and therefore keeps us going ""astray"" is subjective.   I don't just want Muslims answers.   Thanks","God doesn't want blind praise and worship.  He doesn't want worship for his sake, but our sake. We get to worship him because that is our ultimate satisfaction.   Christianity is a story of what God wanted when he created us and how he restored order even when we rebelled.

Its not the ultimate satisfaction though is it. ""Sinning""  is easier, more pleasant and satisfying physically and mentally than worshiping. Ask anyone that is willing to give an honest answer. Obviously I don't mean sins like killing etc. The only satisfaction it can give is spiritually.    &gt;He doesn't want worship for his sake, but our sake  How does it benefit us. The only benefit I can see is that it would remind us of the punishments, which is subjective and would go to show religion is based on the principle of fear.",comment_2,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

To give a little background, my parents are pagans. I was raised as a pagan but stopped as a teenager. I currently don't have any religion.  I went to boarding school then college. I liked living in a dorm because my family is actually quite dysfunctional. But at home during school breaks, I felt sick and lethargic. It's a long story, but I eventually got the sense this wasn't simply a psychological response, but a spiritual one.  My college shut down a few months ago in response to the lockdown, so I had to return home. I've been feeling an evil presence in my room. I have extreme trouble sleeping. I even went 48 hours without sleeping once because I simply couldn't fall asleep despite being exhausted. I wake up really suddenly as if something's waking me up. I have nightmares sometimes (though they aren't waking me up). I've been having chest pain and random stomachaches, and sometimes I suddenly feel sick or lightheaded.  I believe I'm being spiritually attacked. It's complicated and hard to explain, but I never had a good feeling about my parents' religion, and this really only started after I stopped worshiping their gods. I confronted my mother about it, and she yelled at me, which is not like her. She switches between blaming me for what's been happening and pretending nothing has been happening at all.  (I am working on getting health insurance, and I will be seeing a doctor when that gets sorted out. I do not see anything wrong with seeking both medical help and spiritual help at the same time. (I'm highlighting this because I got some unhelpful responses in another sub.))  I know I'm not Christian, but I'm posting on this board because I think it's my best bet to get some advice.

The bad news is that if someone took care of the spiritual problem, but you didn't follow Jesus as Lord, then things would only get worse.

Try to point one out. Every other religious scripture is full of errors but not the quran.   The quran is inimitable. Allah challenged the Arabs of the prophets time to produce a book like it and they were unable to.   The quran is the only ancient religious book which is preserved. Every other religion has either insersions, omissions or no provenance to the author   What I've listed is the necessary conditions for a book to be from god, without these you can discount any claim that a book is from god, however more is needed to solidify any truth claim.   The quran and the hadith are miraculous in that there are prophecies of what is to come, all of which have materialised thus far with few to remain.   The life of the prophet. He was oppressed for his message and was offered everything to end his call. Why would he continue.   He went to war 19 times and he told his companions god would help him, he didn't die in war   His wives testified that he would stand up in prayer for 23 years Every night, what would a liar gain from this.   There is no doubt that Islam is the truth, its evidences aren't based on dreams or a gut feeling. We have tangible proofs and if you reject we'll then that's up to you","It's rather very simple in Islam. Our proof is the holy book, the Quran  Listen to a recitation of Quran and compare the feeling you will have with any other recitation of any other book (can find easily on Youtube, i recommend Islam Sobhy recitation https://youtu.be/Ktq0s5v2kgY)  And read the Quran and compare it with any other religion holybook  Tell you something that i know some people have done before, clean hour self up.

Sometimes the Hebrew original is included along with its transliteration when there is more than one way to translate the English, when the translation is disputable, when the word is unusual, or when there is some interesting word play in the Hebrew.

So can someone direct me to rigorous atheistic explanations of God's nonexistence (i.e. academic books and articles)?

You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.

And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/religion.jsonl,religion.jsonl,3m9x3f,What are the general guidelines during rest days?,"I am trying to modify my own way of life and I noticed that seemingly most religions have a 'day off'. And it made me think of implementing such a weekly restday as well, having a day were you are freed from most obligations (work, study...) is probably mentally a very good thing .  I do realise however that spending the day gaming for instance would be a very lousy way of resting. So I was wondering if you guys would be able to tell me what could be some general guidelines for a restday, guidelines that you might find in most religions who observe a rest day.  I hope my question is clear :)","It varies a lot across religions, and so does the frequency.  I'll illustrate two examples.    For strict, observant orthodox Jews, Shabbat is every Friday night to Saturday night, and there are a lot of prohibitions.  No turning on/off lights, operating anything electronic, shopping, cooking, gardening, washing, writing, etc.  [source](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/95907/jewish/The-Shabbat-Laws.htm).  My impression is that Jews use this time to spend with their family and for religious observances.  The Bah√°'√≠s take off only 9 days per year.  Here's a description of it.  The only real restriction is that we don't do work (but there are various exceptions possible), but there's advice on how to spend this time:  &gt; In the sacred Laws of God, in every cycle and dispensation, there are blessed feasts, holidays and workless days. On such days all kinds of occupations, commerce, industry, agriculture etc., are not allowed. Every work is unlawful. All must enjoy a good time, gather together, hold general meetings, become as one assembly, so that the national oneness, unity and harmony may become personified in all eyes. As it is a blessed day it should not be neglected or without results by making it a day limited to the fruits of mere pleasure. During such blessed days institutions should be founded that may be of permanent benefit and value to the people so that in current conversation and in history it may become widely known that such a good work was inaugurated on such a feast day.  I would draw your attention to this introduction of, "" In the sacred Laws of God, in every cycle and dispensation...""  As you've noted that the different religions of the world all have these special days.  The Bah√°'√≠ explanation is that the different Prophets of God, like Christ, Moses, Mohammad, and many others (including Dharmic religions too), are all representatives of one God or divine reality.  Each has their own cycle, or dispensation (i.e. religion).  These religions are fundamentally in harmony.    The Prophets have brought different laws (in this case, Holy Days) for humanity at different times to satisfy different needs.  You can imagine how the law of the Sabbath is much more applicable to past times, before the renaissance, industrial revolution and digital revolution, than it is today.  And, that's why it totally makes sense in a historical context.",[Categories of activity prohibited on shabbat.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_prohibited_on_Shabbat),comment_1,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/TrueChristian) if you have any questions or concerns.*","The one thing the Bible is clear on is that **nothing is inherently sinful** (Romans 14:14).  Jesus says it's what comes out of a man (i.e. from his heart) that makes him unclean, not what goes in (Matthew 15:18).  That said, whether or not something can be done with a pure heart is a different matter.  Most people, for example, cannot intentionally open up pornography alone on their computer at night with a pure heart.  The act itself is not sinful, but there's no rational way to do that act without sin.  So, the question shouldn't be whether or not the act is ""inherently sinful,"" rather you should be asking if it can be done with a pure heart.  As to that, the Bible isn't clear on this, so you're going to have to go with what you believe the Spirit has convicted you toward.  My personal view is that it would be sinful for me because the Spirit has given me a personal conviction against this.  That conviction is grounded in the character of God and the way he has oriented relationships.  We are one with the Spirit because the Spirit enters us and indwells us, not the other way around.  Ephesians 5 tells us that the husband-wife relationship is meant to be paralleled with the Christ-church relationship.  So, if I am the bride of Christ and Christ indwells me and not the other way around, I am convicted that I should indwell within my wife and not the other way around when we are expressing a physical symbol of oneness and indwelling.  That said, this is just one of several possible legitimate interpretations.  God didn't give clarity because he doesn't expect strict obedience on this issue to some standard.  That makes it a disputable matter subject to Romans 14.  That doesn't mean you can do whatever you want and then claim a pure motive, otherwise I'd just choose not to ask the Spirit for conviction on anything.  Rather, we are to seek God and listen to the Spirit through Scripture, prayer, and with an open and repentant heart - and thereafter to come to our convictions.  Only then can we do something with a pure heart.",comment_2,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

First, the Prophet could not have gone against the Quran to marry a physically and intellectually immature child. Secondly, the age of Hazrat Aisha can be easily calculated from the age of her elder sister Hazrat Asma who was 10 years older than Hazrat Aisha. Waliuddin Muhammad Abdullah Al-Khateeb al Amri Tabrizi the famous author of Mishkath, in his biography of narrators (Asma ur Rijal), writes that Hazrat Asma died in the year 73 Hijri at the age of 100, ten or twelve days after the martyrdom of her son Abdullah Ibn Zubair. It is common knowledge that the Islamic calendar starts from the year of the Hijrah or the Prophet‚Äôs migration from Mecca to Medina. Therefore, by deducting 73, the year of Hazrat Asma‚Äôs death, from 100, her age at that time, we can easily conclude that she was 27 years old during Hijra.This puts the age of Hazrat Aisha at 17 during the same period. As all biographers of the Prophet agree that he consummated his marriage with Hazrat Aisha in the year 2 Hijri it can be conclusively said that she was 19 at that time and not nine as alleged in the aforementioned hadiths.‚Äù  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/tpdoj5)","Well she was 14-16 when they got married, 17-19 when they consummated the marriage",Late teenage years/early adulthood basically,comment_1,Provides clarifying comments,Provides clarifying comments,,,,,No,0.4722025132

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/Talmud.jsonl,Talmud.jsonl,8o0fv6,Is there any hint in the Talmud that god has a meaningful name containing a future form of the verb To Be?,"I see the pro and contra posts on a new celeb \(his name is unimportant from my point of view\). But I feel it is absurd that he has discovered a materialistic solution to the thousand years old god\-question and no one has acknowledged or perceived it\- everyone always discussing only his take on gender which is nothing special. \(I would like to write about this but I \- although I learned in  a Conservative University of Rabbinical Studies for years \- I never found any hint to this in the Talmud.  Only in Ashlag and Leiner's May Shiloah.\)  This lecturer  is acknowledging in his book /entitled Maps of Meaning \(1999\) on p. 54 /and also in a video about ‚ÄûExtravertist and Neuroticist Temperament‚Äù \(no. 15\)/ his indebtedness to Pavlov‚Äôs followers quoted by J.A. Gray, who have proven by EEG and other tools that the good\-feel hormone dopamine is created by a progress forward to a better Ideal Future vision of the self. \(Remember ‚Äúpavlovian dogs‚Äù salivating at the sight of a light signifying future meal. If ‚Äûfuture‚Äù \(goal\) is more important than other things it will create a ‚Äúdominance hierarchy‚Äù. And this is a conceptual starting point to combat anarchic leftism that claim the texts are endless interpretations \(not endless, sure\) that are only serving the powerful \(not true they are just competent\)¬†: thus creating a horizontal worldview and this relativism may cause depression. Not by chance, some important Jewish teachings claim that the Eternal has not created the physical world \(which is void of affective values, says Peterson\) but only the human future\-vision was created \(for Adam and later prophets in the Jewish Bible where we see first the promise of Moses‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe first Mashiah/Anointed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääreappearing in each generation.\) /This is explained best here by Russell Hendel: [http://www.rashiyomi.com/gen\-1.htm](http://www.rashiyomi.com/gen-1.htm)/  So the controversial new celeb \(really let us not mention his name now\) simply  omits the fact that this is done with the use of this name meaning ‚ÄúWill\-Being‚Äù¬†. \(As the Eternal /=Yehaweh/ himself explains in 2Moses 3:14, saying ‚ÄúTell them the WillBeing sent you to them‚Äù.\)  Yehaweh in Hebrew\- says the newworldencyclopedia.org means ‚ÄûTo Be‚Äù in future tense active mode.\(It would be Futurator in Latin\). Obviously an Ideal Future Fantasy. Does not exist in the present. It only Will Be being. In the Future or in the fantasies about that progressively evoluing future. Best translation would be ‚ÄúEvolution or Progress.‚Äù  So regardless of the sudden fame of this famous lecturer I just wanted to share I feel awful about his forgetting to mention his source material.  And no, I was not born into the religion that professes this future\-god concept \(although I plan to convert maybe\). I just wanted to vent about this. Thanks for listening.",Are you still wanting an answer to this?,"Haha. I forgot I wrote it. Of course I mentioned it elsewhere and my mistaken thinking was pointed out to me many times. How the future tense was expressed differently in biblical times. How we lost the vowels hence an exact translation is impossible. How it is supposed to be past and present and future together. Still as we do know the past and present the only invisible part for us remains the future. The fact remains this godname has a meaning content hinting at some inner experience of an expectation  - compared to the syllable "" god"" or "" dieu"" or "" bog"" which are empty and only consensual. And even the translation 'eternal' hints at the future too. But for some reason the frequent explanations of Greek words is customary ( we are told even in travel guides that katharsis means cleaning) no Christian or Muslim preacher ever mentions that the name of god has a meaning. Imagine people would be made aware that whenever they have fears or hopes for the future  - practically always - they encounter "" god the eternal"" in their daily life. But no I do not await any reaction - I understand mist people just do not care about such stuff.",comment_1,Seeks out new information,,,,,,No,0.04466138515

If your relationship has been romantic, the two of you can decide together if you want to continue it or end it.  Yes, it absolutely matters how you end this, regardless of what type of relationship it was.  You do not just disappear and treat another person as if they were nothing.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/FAITH.jsonl,FAITH.jsonl,88fgd3,Help me understand Faith.,"I do not understand the concept of Faith.  This is a recent realisation in my life, reaching me after a few months, years, even, of studying a certain amount of belief systems. Delving deeper into the philosophy of a few creeds that attract me (for various reasons) made me ponder the questions of metaphysical philosophy a lot more than I did before, even though I am an enthusiast of the matter. I slowly came to notice that I had no grip at all of what ""Faith"" means, and means especially to religion and spirituality.  Growing up in a, say, secular home means that I had no beliefs taught to me since I was young, as is the case, I presume, with the great majority of people. Therefore, when asked to identify ""where do I fall"" on the colossal range of beliefs, I identify as agnostic, and for a long time have called myself an atheist. That fact changed ever so slightly over the years. A history lover, I began to research a few ""pagan"" and neo-pagan beliefs; I got into the animist afro-Brazilian tradition (Umbanda and Candombl√©) followed by most of my immediate family; and I, for cultural and ethnic reasons, researched a lot about Islam (not to mention the bits of knowledge accumulated about many other beliefs around the world).  However, this peculiar upbringing (at least for my country), and recent ""overload"" of different dogmas, creeds and conceptions of God or spirit have left me castaway; trapped in a small and lonely island amid the sea of Faith that everyone else seems to sail and enjoy. Metaphors aside, and in conclusion, I feel that I cannot quite grasp the idea of Faith, its manifestations and the way it acts upon someone and the way one acts within it. Is it a choice? Is it an emotion? A feeling? If so, how does one draw a line; a border, however faint, between the realms of emotion, spirit and reason? What causes one to convert to religions as demanding as Islam or E. Orthodoxy? Are these beliefs actually so present in the lives of believers, or is it just a misconception?  To sum it all up, I cannot understand the causes and effects of Faith, and I do not feel able to identify it. I submitted this post because I wanted to listen to some opinions by people ready to engage in healthy conversation and maybe shine some light upon the darker corners of my understanding.   So, please, if anyone would like to present their opinions and experiences regarding Faith(s), they would be most welcome.","As a fellow agnostic (but leaning towards there being a mystery to the universe we cannot explain), I think it's good to think about the things you have ""faith"" in: maybe your parents, friends, family, etc. You know they ""could"" dissapoint you, and you are aware that you can't know the future, yet you maintain that they will probably treat you right.   Similarly, your simple beliefs like the idea that the sun will rise tomorrow or your foot won't fall through the floor. You can test every day, but can you ever be *totally* sure? There is a bit of faith involved, which really is tied in with trust.   There are also many metaphysical beliefs we actually have very little direct apprehension of: how do we know other people are really alive and not just philosophical zombies? Sure, we can see the brain light up when people think, but how do we *know*?   There are big limits to human knowledge, and I think faith allows a person to function in that fog with a bit of confidence. Whether you should have faith in some religion...I don't think so. Blind faith probably isn't good.","Not to oversimplify, but the belief in something unseen or unknown.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/Catholicism.jsonl,Catholicism.jsonl,uvj2ck,What does Catholic sexuality look like?,"I've read the CCC and the Catholic Answers Q&amp;A pages about masturbation, sex, marriage, etc. and it left me very confused.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The Catholic Church, in *Humanae Vitae* and other documents, condemns contraception because the person who uses it to prevent pregnancy intentionally thwarts the primary end of the sexual act, procreation   &gt;   &gt;... the secondary and complementary end is unitive love...  In short, contraception is prohibited and all sexual acts must be made with the end-goal of procreation in mind. If procreation is not your goal and say you have sex solely as an expression of love within a marriage -- it would be a sin.  Now, let's take an average couple living in an industrialized nation, like the United States -- earning the median household salary of $67,000. Were they earnest in following the Catholic strictures (or at least my understanding of them), they would have few options:  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Celibacy method** Try to provide a decent life for 1, perhaps 2 children at most -- this method means that sex might literally only happen once or twice during the entirety of the marriage. 2. **YOLO method** Have procreative sex with little regard to the child's quality of life -- this method relies on welfare, charity and would likely involve abject poverty.  3. **Hustle method** Orient your life around the accumulation of money to be able to maintain some semblance of a sex life whilst also providing a decent life for the children - this method would likely have you 'hustling' most of your waking hours, leaving you very little time with your family. 4. **Roulette method** Using natural family planning methods you can reduce the chances of pregnancy but not eliminate it -- this method would mean that you could have a sex life, quality of life for each child would be decent, but looming over every procreative act would be the chance of destroying your family financially.  I feel like I really must be misunderstanding or missing something because all of these options sound maddening.","Your view is a little narrow.

The two main competing views are that the story is **literal** and that it's **allegorical**. Both views bring their own set of problems to the table. However, I personally take the view that the story is **allegorical**. This is a predominant view amongst open theologians and liberal Christians.   I believe the story is allegorical for a few reasons:  1. The consensus from all terrestrial and cosmological scientific data suggests that the earth is not less around 6,000 years old, as outlined in the Biblical timeline. The age of the earth is not exclusive to allegory, but it does leave room for questioning. (Note: Christians who believe in a literal 6-days of creation and a literal 6,000 year timeline are known as **Young Earth Creationists** or **YEC** for short).  2. The Book of Revelation is largely regarded as allegorical in nature, even though in most of the book, it's never explicitly stated. The chances that the Book of Genesis is framed in the same manner should not be taken of the table.  3. Genesis has multiple literary schemes in the original Hebrew language, but much of it is written as poetry. This says to me that it was relayed through oral accounts as folklore, not history.  4. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence for evolution; from vestigial legs on whales to recent variations of species. The fossil records are also largely consistent when compared on average, not separately.   This is my view and I do not wish to enter into a derogatory debate, but I'm open to civil discussion. If you have an opposing view, you may want to create a separate response to the OP and link to it when responding here. That way, the differing views are easier to reference.

Like I had stepped into something else. Then I caught the eye of a deer and her fawn and we had a stare off for a few seconds. I backed away to let them know I was non threatening and they continued on their way. I was overcome by emotion. I stayed for 5 min longer then left. I felt like I had no reason to hang around.  I live in a city and I consider myself very fortunate to have somewhere nearby to ‚Äúforest bathe‚Äù.  Was any of this spiritual? Was it all just a coincidence?

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/OpenChristian.jsonl,OpenChristian.jsonl,13fqwu,My writings on the causes of sexuality (Critique?),"**Please note I am working on the bibliography, I am looking mostly for critique on how it is written and if there is any more studies someone can point me to. This is for a blog**          Before we can analyze any other parts about sexuality, first we should look at theorized causes, and a very brief look how the thoughts on it have developed throughout history. Just as cultures change throughout history, so do attitudes. The attitudes towards sexuality and even sex in general have been anything but consistent, and often attitudes of the past would be condemned in modern culture almost, if not, instantly and entirely.  We must be careful how we use these terms, and for the sake of such, we will first refer to sexual actions. This is because what we now think of sexuality (Sexual Orientation, the inclination of attraction towards a specific gender or group of genders) was not known for a long time. The concept of such a definition of sexuality, that people actually had a certain innate desire towards one or the other, was not developed until about the 19th century. As such, it is impossible to discuss histories view on sexual orientation, but focus instead upon the sexual acts.  Ancient Greece is a particularly favorite point of discussion on this topic, as Greece was known for a lot of freedom in sexual practices. Ancient Greek Cultures have been everything from children growing up to serve in the army being assigned adult male lovers, to widely accepted prostitution, to The Sacred Band of Thebes, an army consisting of 150 male-male couples that was devastatingly powerful. Essentially, what we would consider bisexuality, was a pretty normal occurrence in Greek culture, it was a part of everyday life, sex was almost like a mark of freedom to enjoy life. This view of freedom is significantly different in countries of the same period and in history.  In Israel, sexuality was something that was exclusively bound to having children. Homosexuality in this time was considered just as dreadful and even against the nation to doing anything that would lead not lead to pregnancy, including ‚Äúpulling out‚Äù and oral sex. Both as a means of separating the culture of Israel from other countries surrounding, and also to encourage the nation to grow, sexuality was set forth only as a way to bear children.  But as we fast-forward in history what we find is a whole new attitude on sexual practices. Soon it became more like a symbol or show of dominance or control. In a large portion of history, it became almost common practice for an army to rape the members of the opposing army that they defeated. This was a show of dominance to humiliate the army members, but was not limited to the army. It was also not unusual for a man to assert his dominance to a slave by sexual acts, regardless of gender. An establishment of power was the driving factor often, showing that they could get their sexual pleasure when they wanted, where they wanted.  But what I‚Äôve found as we progressed towards more modern times is almost a half-step backwards. Now I say half-step for this reason. While certainly with the modern age there has been much more-so a concept of sexual actions for love, however even now sex is often almost a freedom to enjoy life among some cultures. While perhaps not to the same extent, sex is often promoted as a rite of passage, something that you do after puberty. However, the half comes in because sex with the same gender become something taboo, something frowned upon, looked upon as unnatural, a mental illness, and interpreted as a lack of fitting your gender role.  But with the development of the concept of sexual orientation, the way was paved for an acceptance of it. However, the acceptance would not be immediate. First there had to be a denial of the nature of it (as shown by it being thought of as a mental illness first) and opposition or even violent opposition (shown by how LGBT has been treated in recent history.) However, the exact answer has always eluded us. What even does cause the development of sexual orientation? Is it innate and genetic, or determined by factors in life? Many answers have been proposed, and studies done, and the best conclusion we can muster up is, a little of both.  In an effort to see if there is a genetic factor, multiple studies (Kallman, 1952) (Heston &amp; Shields, 1968) (Bailey &amp; Pillard, 1991) have been done on twins, by taking homosexuals that have identical twins and comparing how often the other twin is also homosexual. While the results varied, a safe range came between 40-60% of the time that if one was homosexual, both were. This shows a correlation between sexuality and genetics that is even stronger than that of being right or left handed. However, assuming then that sexuality is completely genetic would ignore many other factors.  A study by Brock University (St. Catherines, Canada, 2006) have also shown a correlation between increased likelihood of homosexuality and the number of older brothers a male has. For each older brother, the chances increased by 28-48%. This is also easily explainable, as to a mother‚Äôs body, a male fetus is almost like a foreign object. The body then produces antigens that go into the fetus and make it more ‚Äúfeminine.‚Äù As the mother has more male children, her body becomes more adept at doing this and injects more each time.  A similarly based theory is the digit-length ratio, a theory involving the length of your ring and index finger developed after a study by the University of California at Berkeley. The more testosterone you are exposed to in the womb, this has shown to have an increase on the length of your ring finger, the opposite being true of estrogen. This is something that is determined in the womb, and has shown some correlation between gay males most often having their index and ring finger closer in length than those of heterosexual males.  Now, there are other shown physiological differences between homosexual and heterosexual individuals, and these are just some highlights and some of the strongest correlations. So if there is all this evidence about things out of anyone‚Äôs control in genetic and pre-natal development it must be genetic right? Well, it‚Äôs not exactly that simple.  Freud has developed a theory on homosexuality that relied entirely upon nurture. He stated that homosexuality was directly caused when a man has an absent father and an overbearing mother. The idea is often rejected now, but a certain idea of that has not been completely rejected. From research on 275 men in the Taiwanese military, Bin Ching Shu &amp; For Wey Lung had shown a correlation between homosexual men often having more a rough relationship with their father than heterosexuals. Whether this is a correlation or a causation has not been determined, but we cannot fully reject that it may be a factor.   As well, even just a simple conversation with many members of the LGBT community can show that these factors are not always determining. Some gay or bi men may be the oldest sibling or even an only child. There are twins where one is homosexual and the other is not. Even the digit-length ratio, by that theory I should be as straight as a rod (My ring finger is *very* noticeably longer than my index finger) but I don‚Äôt think my boyfriend would exactly believe that.  As well then we must also take into account other sexualities. Alfred Kinsey and his colleagues Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin developed the ‚ÄúKinsey Scale‚Äù in 1948 as a way of ‚Äúrating‚Äù sexuality, leaning towards homosexual or heterosexual, but it often was not exclusive across time. This will be covered more in ‚ÄúSexual Fluidity‚Äù and ‚ÄúBreaking the Binary,‚Äù however it shows that we must take into account that sexuality is not just heterosexual or homosexual. What about asexuals? Bisexuals? Pansexuals? There is still much research to be done, but it requires a denial of reality to dismiss genetic and pre-natal factors in sexual development.","&gt; But as we fast-forward in history what we find is a whole new attitude on sexual practices. Soon it became more like a symbol or show of dominance or control.  How is pederasty not a showing of dominance or control?  The greeks certainly saw penetration as feminizing.  This is why only slaves, women, and enemies were acceptably penetrated.  I think this is there from the beginning.  It's also, in part, how I understand Lev. 18:22.  Quite literally, it is banned because it's feminizing.  But I think there are two things that would add to your study.  First is looking at Roman relationships.  The Church develops her sexual ethics in the face of what Rome had been doing.  So if you want some sense of Christian interpretations of Scripture you need to look at Rome.  I also think you don't do enough to address gender.  I think the rise of homosexuality as a concept (hell, sexuality as a concept) is correlative to the switch from gender to sex in the industrial revolution.  The rest is great and informative!","Well, what I've found at least in study with ancient Greeks is that often sexuality for them was encouraged to be explored, especially because the genders were often segregated at young ages for a time. But I will definitely look more into things. As for Gender, I actually do plan on talking about this issue, there is much more about sexuality I plan on talking about along with Gender, this is just like a first section.",comment_2,"Recognizes limitations in one‚Äôs own knowledge or beliefs,

I started wondering - if we always have a device with us that can solve a particular problem, what's the difference between using it and doing it ourselves?

In revelations six it describes what will happen with the horsemen and the plagues. Famine, fires that cover a third of the earth, the heavens being pulled back and the men of the earth hiding underground from the scorching wrath of God. The sky turns black ( which would happen if the atmosphere burned away) everything would fall from the sky ( as described in revelations 6, it refers to it as the stars but everything in the atmosphere would fall to the earth)  the earth would tremble (sound waves wouldn't be heard but everything could be felt through vibrations)  and then the earth would become so unbearably hot that all life would be purged (as it says in 2 Peter 3 ((10¬†The day of the Lord will come as a robber comes. The heavens will pass away with a loud noise. The sun and moon and stars will burn up. The earth and all that is in it will be burned up.)))

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/humanism.jsonl,humanism.jsonl,173no7,Tolerating racism/homophobia?,"Interesting topic came up in a conversation between me and my Dad.  To be completely tolerant of other peoples beliefs, does that mean we have to tolerate racists and homophobic's?    This also made me think of another question.  How do we define ""not tolerating"".  Is it as simple as not agreeing with them, or does it need to be more extreme, like wanting to cause bodily harm to someone you don't ""tolerate"".  Where is the line that crosses from tolerating to not tolerating?","There's a difference between not judging an individual based on race/sex/gender/ and sexual orientation, and not judging an individual based on his character.   To tolerate an intolerable person strengthens his intolerance, because you've given him an unspoken acceptance to be intolerable towards x, y, z.   My personal belief on being intolerant is simply not being able to handle the other person's actions (some people would replace ""actions"" with beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) or making fun of an entire race/culture/lifestyle because of one's understand of it. Other people have different definitions, this is my personal one.  * For example, when my friend --the less open-minded in the group --makes a racist joke, even if it's just him and I, I'll kindly tell him how I don't think it's funny, how it's wrong to perpetuate negative stereotypes, it shows his ignorance towards the other race's culture, and how I know for a fact not all people of that race are like that.","I like stoic philosophy for this type of situation.    This is one quote that is related:  "" Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away. ""  The translation is 100+ years old but it is still a good concept.  A stoic would be concerned only with their own character they called virtue, and as I understand it the correct approach would be to set an example by how you live.. If anything at all is said to them it would be related to what your beliefs are.  For example,""I don't believe in racism, I believe the dignity of each person and judge them by their actions not by their genetics.""  If you are reacting negatively to a persons opinions such that you feel intolerant you are then creating the same problem you seek to alleviate.   I agree it is an interesting paradox, and when I was much younger I would often say, ""the only thing I can't tolerate is intolerant people"" as a joke but that passes if you can change how you view the world.  People from all sides of any issue have valid reasons, in their own minds, for being intolerant.  These ideas shaped by the combination of their genetics and life experiences.",comment_1,Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,"Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,

It would be fitting to introduce the heroine into the recapitulation of the plot, but since Esther is not mentioned in the context (she is last mentioned in 9:13) this translation is unnatural.  Some modern translators‚Ä¶ treat the feminine as a neuter ‚Äòit‚Äô or ‚Äòthis,‚Äô i.e., [in other words] the matter of Haman‚Äôs conspiracy which came before the king at Esther‚Äôs second banquet.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,vx0bxf,Is morality independent of God?,So it goes like this:  If God knows what is good and what is evil then that means morality is independent because knowledge is independent of the being otherwise God does not know what is good and evil and it's just God's subjective opinion of what is good and evil.  Note: focusing on the Abrahamic God.,"&gt; If S knows p, then p is independent of S  This seems straightforwardly false, as I have knowledge of my taste in music, but my taste in music is not independent of me.  I think what this argument needs is an analysis of morality itself, which may involve considerations about moral knowledge in particular. It seems that when discussing what is right we are not trying to figure out what someone's tastes are like, even if they are maximally rational. We're trying to find out how certain things are like independent of what anyone thinks.  Indeed, one might point out that if theists take on a divine commandment theory, then their description of God as among other things *morally perfect* seems superfluous. If God is/stipulates the standard of morality, then she cannot ever fail to satisfy it maximally and therefore be morally perfect. But it seems like being morally perfect is a genuine part of being God: it's a distinct property from omnipotence, for instance. So DCT must be false.","Curious, you say you are focusing on the  ‚ÄúAbrahamic God‚Äù in relation to your query, which indicates that under a different system of God or the gods the answer to your question might differ. If it does then what does that mean? Does it mean that the God or gods are in contradiction? Or that these others are automatically dismissed for not aligning with your tradition? If the latter the case then I don‚Äôt see why you are asking a question as opposed to simply telling us what you believe.  Making an argument strictly within a tradition is not making an argument regarding universal truths but is a limitation not an advancement to truth. You might have well asked under these circumstances ‚ÄúIs morality independent of the Abrahamic God?‚Äù.",comment_1,Condescending Attitude,Provides clarifying comments,,,,,No,0.9451680237

Our religion doesn't have a name, we're not organized or anything beyond a small group of friends who all share beliefs together, but if anyone may be interested in hearing what we believe I'd like to share it!  So firstly, ultimately, and most importantly, we believe the ultimate goal of morality is to live simply, comfortably, and humbly, according to one's role in their family, ecosystem, and community. We're not concerned with faith based propositions and don't seek to adopt inconsistent, supernatural, or unscientific beliefs, though our values differ from the standard mainstream moral values. We don't worship anything, we don't believe in souls or persistent selves, no afterlife or magic.   Our values can be very well summed up in two major symbols; the leaf, and the blade.  The leaf is meant to be drawn on the back of one's hand, and redrawn every time it starts to fade. It's specifically meant to be drawn as opposed to tattooed because it's meant to fade, the act of redrawing it is an important ritual and the process of it fading is supposed to remind one of impermanence, emptiness, and the eternal cycle of the bubbling into existence and the return back to nothingness. It also represents growth, fertility, and birth, as well as family, one's line of ancestors and descendents, respect, and other concepts that branch from them. It also represents potential, and the primal undifferentiated drive of the universe and all living things. As such, it is a good representation of motivation regardless of what Goal one may follow.  Any symbol really could well work, since the practical mental benefit comes from the act of drawing and seeing it as a reminder to act according to your goal and values. It's on the hand as a reminder every time you see it that all the actions you do with your hands should be consistent with your beliefs. The image we use of the leaf comes from a parable we tell about karma; a fish, a stick, and a leaf are all in a flowing stream. The stick, stuck between the banks, causes allot of turbulence and goes nowhere. The fish, though it may be moving plenty, is still fighting the current, stuck in place, and causing allot of turbulence. The leaf however floats on top the current, causing none.  The blade is any physical tool with which one can construct the rest of the things a person needs to survive, meant to be carried on one's person at all times. In practice for most of us, this tends to be pocket knives, though there were a few years where everywhere I went I had my axe on my belt with me. We don't believe a human is complete without their knife, it's a part of our body as much as a dog's tooth or a sparrow's liver, and a human cannot survive without one. Our ancestors have lived for millions of years with blades, they have been a vital part of our history since before our genus evolved, and they're even an inate part of our psychology. To us, they represent many of the counterpart components to those of the leaf; harvest, death, predation, but it also represents self-sufficiency, adaptability, humility, and respecting one's place within the ecosystem. It also represents reality, in the sense of the clear definition between truth and false and the infinitsmal divide between past and present, among other analogies.  The self-sufficiency part is pretty important to us, along with living according to our ecological role. Well all those principles are pretty important to us, but the practical effects of following these two principles in particular are the most obvious to other people, because for those reasons we strive to make as much of what we use for subsistence purposes (for example, chopping our own firewood or sewing our own clothes) as we can.  Carrying a knife is also extremely practical. I really feel very strongly about this principle. I think it stands well for it's own merits, regardless of the rest of our beliefs, to the extent that if any of you reading this don't have your own knife I'd be happy to make you one and send it to you regardless of what religion you follow, just so more people can carry their own knives. Just send me a PM or post a comment here and I'll get in contact with you.  It's kind of a mix between Taoism and Confucianism. I've even described it as a modern revival of the ancient Chinese religion of Agriculturalism, a bit tongue in cheek since so little is still known about what the Agriculturalists believed. I've also described us as ""Amish Buddhists"", because of our rejection of the concept of self and how most of our rituals are psychological in nature, and our focus on self-sufficiency and the importance of one's community, but it really doesn't have anything to do with those traditions.",Amish Buddhism sounds cool,Isn't that just primitivism?,comment_1,Lacks Constructive Dialogue,Lacks Constructive Dialogue,,,,,No,0.2152818987
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/GodlessWomen.jsonl,GodlessWomen.jsonl,1z25ve,Christians and Rape Culture [trigger],"After a FB discussion with a Mormon regarding the idea of modesty (I was arguing, very respectfully, that the idea of telling a woman to dress modestly to avoid giving men impure thoughts added to rape culture. She of course disagreed.) I began to think about how much the Christian teachings have added to rape culture, slut shaming, the idea of submissiveness in women, and the dichotomy of the good girl/bad girl. Have any of you experienced this? Or have thoughts?","When I was in the process of leaving my faith I fell in love with a non-christian. I always felt guilty about it, got judged for it by other Christians and my family, and when we eventually had sex, I really had a difficult time enjoying it because I was so wracked with guilt.   I think part of how modesty/purity culture perpetuates rape culture is by making us feel worthless and without a voice. I didn't know what to really ""do"" when it came to sex, and he was a emotionally fucked up lying cheater who wasn't very kind or helpful in the process. How do you know what you enjoy sexually if you don't feel like you should be talking about it, let alone actually doing it? There is no dialogue beforehand about how it should be great and open in terms of communication. I had no basis for comparison because I was a virgin, and I couldn't fucking talk to anyone.   I think Christian culture perpetuates shame about your body (even though they claim to celebrate sex and the body, but only in marriage), and that, in turn, makes it extremely difficult to talk about how you feel once you do have sex, and not feeling like you can have an opinion much less voice it certainly perpetuates rape culture.","this all sounds like a major reach effort trying to combine religion and a rape culture. first we have to ask if we are in a rape culture and i don't think that's the case.   then, singling out christians as part of the reason for this imagined rape culture is a further reach.   what we should be addressing is the culture of male domination which transcends belief systems. but that's a different reddit. as much as i don't care for religions or the concept of god, i won't put ""rape culture"" on christianity or theistic religion. it's far too narrow and severely misdirected.   it's one thing to be pro-atheist but it's kind of Crusades-ish to demonize christianity in such a blatant way. the more i involve myself in this atheist world, the more i want to just be a hermit. atheists are becoming evangelical with their beliefs, like a tea party of non believers.",comment_1,"Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,

I have struggled with my opinion of Joseph Smith since spending the last few years more objectively studying his life. In fact, I respect the RLDS/CoC church for their more ""flexibile"" acceptance (non-acceptance in some cases?) of who Joseph Smith was and the Book of Mormon. My understanding is that this more nuanced acceptance of Joseph came from a more critical examination of Joseph's life, and the reality that certain historical evidence couldn't simply be swept under the rug (which the LDS church was been effective at pre-Google)  Quick question: how important of a role does the Spirit play in confirming the truth of Joseph Smith and the restoration? Is Moroni 10:3-5 emphasized in the same manner that I am accustomed to in the Salt Lake City branch? Meaning, the spirit is the ultimate confirmer of truth.

The role of the Church is an inviting one, but should [not]*seek to interfere with each person's relationship with his Lord.  This has complex implications.  We read in the New Testament that the people of the early church were of one heart and one mind, but we also know that they had many disputes.

It is largely subjective in the context of this post.  There's no way to measure how much someone values their material life and there's no real helpful way to compare the different amounts between people.  So this argument aims to do away with the 'Person X values life more than person Y' approach and instead, focus on how certain beliefs limit your ability to value life, rather than outright devalue life.  Fortunately its a simple argument.  If you believe in an eternal afterlife, then that afterlife, by necessity, is going to be the more important life.  Only a fool who has no idea what 'eternity' means would argue otherwise.  This is the limitation placed on the value of material life by Christian theology.  It is a limitation of hierarchy.  Material life cannot be the *most* important life, because it by necessity needs to be less important than the eternal life.  ""That may be the case,"" I hear you saying, ""but even still, since the eternal life is so important, it makes material life important since that's your test of whether or not you get into heaven.""  And sure.  That's true, material life is still important to a Christian.  However, that material life's value to you is limited, since it *must* rank lower than the eternal life.  Material life is a means to an end for the Christian.  It's value only comes from the existence of the eternal afterlife to a believing Christian.  We see this *all* the time.  Christians making the argument that life is meaningless without their religion being true.  Take away their afterlife, and they have no value for their material life.  A person who does not believe in the afterlife, by contrast, therefore has no hierarchical limit on how valuable material life is.  There is nothing that *must* be more important than material life, and so the non-believer is free to value life in the highest hierarchical slot they choose.  Life needs to play second fiddle to none for a non-believer.  A non-believer can value material life higher than a dogmatic Christian can in terms of hierarchy.  It is possible for *nothing* to be more important than material life to a non-believer, where as a Christian *must* have something valued higher than their material life.  So to be clear, though I still expect comments that don't understand this nuance here: this does *not* mean non-believers *do* value life more than Christians.   I can't prove that and I don't know how anyone even would go about proving that.  I am arguing that it is mandatory for a Christian to value at least one (probably two realistically) thing(s) above the value of their material life, thus limiting it.  I am arguing that if you do not believe in the Christian afterlife you are free to value life in a higher stage of hierarchy than a Christian ever could.  It's not that non-believers *do* value life more than Christians, it's that Christians *can never* value life as much as a non-believer *potentially can*.  Christians *must always* reserve importance for other things above their material life.  I don't need to go into it, but obviously I think believing that all material life is just a means to an end is a very unhealthy and toxic position to take, and I'd like that to change such that all humans everywhere respect and value the one and only life we can be sure we have instead of placing an unproven, unknowable, and frankly silly concept of an afterlife above it.","COMMENTARY HERE: Comments that purely commentate on the post (e.g. ‚ÄúNice post OP!‚Äù) must be made as replies to the Auto-Moderator!  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would suggest, however, that if one's belief in a blessed afterlife is simultaneously a belief in a Sacred Transcendent which also manifests on earth, the problem resolves itself.  Jesus's teaching on the Kingdom of Heaven posited both scenarios: Heaven is both ""more than here"" (""up there"")/transcendent ***and*** ""here""/immanent. The Kingdom of Heaven is an in-breaking reality, so that Jesus says you don't have to look for it in the sea or the sky, precisely because it is already here, ""within you"" and ""among you"".  Thus there is simultaneity and unity between Heaven as transcendent state/realm and Heaven as a living-and-lived reality on this earth. Contradiction, conflict and opposition only come into play if one conceptualizes an unbridgeable gap between earth and Heaven - a dualistic cosmology that the New Testament Jesus is portrayed as rejecting.",comment_2,"Respects Diverse Perspectives,

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/exmormon.jsonl,exmormon.jsonl,1rssv5,How do I date now that I left the church?,"When I was in middle school I discovered porn. A few months later, my parents found out I was watching porn They sent me to this ""camp"", a week of seminars and lessons catered to any christian denomination who are dealing with porn ""addiction"". What I mostly took out of this was basically to avoid women altogether if I ever felt lustful or horny (obviously this goes against most christian beliefs; it was a very poorly executed camp).  Going into high school was very frustrating after this whole thing, as I had a hard time dealing with female classmates (and even some teachers); let's face it, my teenage hormones were going crazy but my devotion to what I believed at the time kept me from being able to interact with women. This lead to a lot of frustration, and I became really anxious and depressed.  I did go on dates in high school, but they were mainly with other mormons to school or church dances, and my date was always arranged. I remember always being really awkward and standoffish on these dates, which made the date usually suck.  I finally left the church when I left home for college, and have overall felt much happier about my life. But ever since I left, dating has been impossible. Though I've reconciled in my mind that you can have a normal relationship even with porn, and that there is nothing wrong with being physically attracted to a girl (and that that is in fact very normal), I still have a hard time in my ""soul"" (if you will) coming to terms with it. It's still hard for me to even look a girl in the eye, let alone strike up a conversation or ask her out on a date.  So the question I raise is this: how do I date now that I left the church?  **TL;DR** I was taught not to think of women in a physical way, and now that I left the church I don't know how to interact with women because I still feel guilty when I feel that way.","I think the main thing to do is to try not to stress about it. By the sounds of it you're still pretty young and have plenty of time to figure it out. When you have something implanted in your mind for so long and so deep, the main thing that helps is time. One day it will be gone and you will meet a wonderful girl and it will be beautiful and you will feel like you can be yourself and be with her in every way.  You can do it! It will happen. I promise. Again, it just takes time and patience and try not to stress about it.","I had the exact same problem as you.  Parents thought I was addicted to porn, spent high school ashamed of physical attraction and couldn't interact with attractive women during my first two years of college. The past year or so, I've finally gotten the hang of dating, and after a couple of dumb hook-ups I found a girl I really care about who I am currently dating.   Here are some pieces of advice from my (admittedly limited) experience.    * find a hobby that involves social interaction with women. You'll meet girls with interests similar to yours, and be able to act comfortable.    * volunteer a lot. It'll expand your social circle, make you feel happy, and help you remember that being a good person is about improving the world, not suppressing your natural desires 24/7.    * Spend time with attractive women without worrying about asking them out on dates.  The pressure on dates is pretty high and IMO it's easier to get to know somebody when you can both relax. If you feel confident enough to ask a girl out, then do it but don't feel like you have to.    * Watch [this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc) TED talk.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_active/TrueChristian.jsonl,TrueChristian.jsonl,8h0srd,Homosexuality: A fall from grace,"Homosexuality is a disgrace.  It is important to say this, in order to emphasize how bad it truly is. Now, this post will mostly focus on homosexuality itself, and less on the people who practice it.  Genesis  In the beginning, God created man, to His image. He established man to dominate over the animals. However, He says in Genesis 2:18 that ‚ÄúIt is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for‚Äù. This leads to the creation of Eve.  This leads to the first issue of homosexuality. The key in this verse are the words ‚Äúfit for‚Äù. As we see, God decides it‚Äôs necessary for man to have a partner, a helper fit for, and He creates a woman. However, homosexuality contradicts God‚Äôs judgment, as it decides that man is fully capable of helping himself, and does not need a woman to do so (or vice versa, in case of women). A man is not fit to help himself, to be a partner for himself. If this were possible, God probably would never have had created Eve, and women.  God has absolute intelligence, so we know that His judgment, based on His intelligence, is the correct one. Due to this, we know that His judgment in saying that a woman is a suitable helper for a man is correct. Homosexuality, however, disagrees with this reasoning. Since we know that God is always right, it can be concluded that homosexuality is wrong.  Becoming one flesh  Genesis 2:24 explains that ‚ÄúTherefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh‚Äù  This passage not only talks about sex, but marriage in general. The use of the word ‚Äúman‚Äù and ‚Äúwife‚Äù suggests that the becoming of one flesh happens during heterosexual marriage, or after marriage (heterosexual sex) . Either way, marriage is necessary for a man and his wife (woman) to become one flesh. This leads to a second issue of homosexuality. A gay man cannot have a wife, he has a husband. Similarly, a gay woman cannot have a man (husband), as she has a wife. How then, can the becoming of one flesh occur, especially as the two gay partners are not fit for one another? It is important to note that Genesis 9:7 shows God saying ‚ÄúAnd you, be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it.‚Äù This is biologically impossible with homosexuality, and if humans solely engaged in it from the creation, humanity would be extinct.  Leviticus, and the New Testament  To keep this as short as possible, all the passages actively condemning homosexuality will be discussed here.  Leviticus 18:22 ‚ÄúYou shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination‚Äù  Leviticus 20:13 ‚ÄúIf a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.‚Äù  Romans 1:26-28 ‚ÄúFor this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  1 Timothy 1:8-10 ‚ÄúNow we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, **that the law is not laid down for the just but for *the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, *men who practice homosexuality,** enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,‚Äú  1 Corinthians 6:9 ‚ÄúOr do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,‚Äù  As can be noticed, there is a lot of verses that prohibit homosexuality. Homosexuality is called ‚Äúshameless‚Äù, ‚Äúdishonourable‚Äù, and an ‚Äúabomination. It is even considered so severe, that those who practice it will not be going to heaven, and the Bible includes homosexuality specifically. Surely, such description of something cannot indicate that the thing is from God. The Bible is very clear on this topic, homosexuality is not to be performed.  Leviticus 18 focuses on sexual immoralities. Putting homosexuality in this chapter is a clear indication that it is sexual immorality. It is comparable to bestiality, and incest. How then, can we claim that homosexuality is good? 1 Corinthians 6:17-20 says that sinning sexually is unlike any other sins, because it is sinning against one‚Äôs own body, which is the temple of the Holy Spirit. We must aim to avoid sexual immorality, which includes homosexuality.  Health &amp; Family  Unsurprisingly, sinning leads us on a dark path, a wrong direction. Homosexuality is the cause of many issues. This can be seen, as practicecers of homosexuality have higher health risks than those who don‚Äôt. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has statistics that showed, for example, that STDs are rising among gay and bisexual men, and that ‚ÄúIn 2014, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men accounted for 83% of primary and secondary syphilis cases where sex of sex partner was known in the United States‚Äù. Also, ‚ÄúGay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are 17 times more likely to get anal cancer than heterosexual men‚Äù. This is a very serious issue, but also, a consequence of sinful behaviour.  Then there is also the destruction of families that homosexuality brings. A lot of families get torn apart when a member decides to start engaging in homosexuality. Homosexuality brings shame and disgrace upon families, which is why we see statistics such as ‚ÄúAbout four-in-ten (39%) say that at some point in their lives they were rejected by a family member or close friend because of their sexual orientation or gender identity; 30% say they have been physically attacked or threatened; 29% say they have been made to feel unwelcome in a place of worship; and 21% say they have been treated unfairly by an employer‚Äù. We can see how homosexuality destroys not just families, but friendships, and potentially careers.  How to deal with homosexuality  We should not engage in it at all. There are consequences for doing so. However, we should follow the golden rule, and treat people who engage in it like we would want to be treated ourselves. If we have friends and family struggling with homosexuality, we should help them overcome this struggle, while refusing to declare that homosexuality is good. We should also encourage them towards celibacy.  If one suffers from homosexual temptations from the devil, they should engage in hard prayer and fasting, and should be open to be celibate. It is important to note that no-one is both homosexual, as this suggests that this cannot be changed (similar to skin colour). Rather, one may grow up struggling with demonic attacks of homosexual temptations. We have seen that homosexuality is not from God.  Conclusion  Homosexuality is not from God, it is from the devil. From Biblical verses, we can see how homosexuality contradicts what God has planned for humanity, and how badly it is sinful. We can also see the negative impact it has in society. We should pray that God may deliver those who suffer from those temptations, that they may open their hearts to serve the Lord while celibate.  Homosexuality is a disgrace.","&gt;Then there is also the destruction of families that homosexuality brings. A lot of families get torn apart when a member decides to start engaging in homosexuality.

At school, I have learned that bid'ah is something that the prophet pbuh and his Companions never did during their lifetime. Things like adding rakaat to prayers and reciting the quran in a different language during prayers. My problem started when I read a book titled 'The Deviant Teachings'( The title is translated from Malay). Anyway, the book contains a lot of rants about tradition among the muslims living in the South East Asia region like marriage customs or entertainment like folk music and such. The book claims a lot of our everyday culture as deviant. As far as I'm concerned, all the things we practice differently from other muslims do not violate any islamic law that is decreed on the Quran. Practices that is considered as tradition that violates the law is quickly removed and eliminated. However, this book claims that all those so called deviant practices is bid'ah or innovation. I thought about it for a while and even ask my religious teacher about it, but the answer did not satisfy me. Then, I started asking about technological advancements, how about cars or airplanes that do not exist during the time of Muhammad pbuh? How about the dua I recited every time I'm about to face my physics exam? ( Muhammad pbuh never did any type of exam as far as I my knowledge goes except those Allah gave which is harder than any exam I'll face in my lifetime). So, scholars of reddit, enlighten me with your brilliant answers.","I'm no scholar so I can't answer you but it made me think about  an incident.   Generally,  my  relatives all meet up at someone's  house and recite the quran if someone dies.   It's not part of Islam but it's more of a culture thing.   My friend who grew  up in the middle east told me that it  is biddah because the prophet didn't do it.   But I told him, but this incident made us all get together and read quran otherwise we would have not read quran on that day.

Thanks so much for helping me understand this!,I would really like to see the answers to this. Other than certain creeds and icOnography what are major differences ?,"There are several internal differences and several external differences. I'll try to highlight a few, but know that there are many more. My former priest always used to say that Protestantism and Catholicism were two sides of the same coin compared with Orthodoxy.  Internally, the theology is based more on theosis than atonement. Theosis was once explained to me like with the following metaphor: an iron rod is put closer and closer to a fire. The iron eventually takes on all the properties of the fire (heat, light) but it never becomes the fire. Theosis is the faithful becoming like god, but moreso. It begins now and continues through eternity.  The Eastern Orthodox don't accept the Western interpretation of ""Original Sin."" They believe that you can't inherit guilt, only the consequences of a parent's action. For example, if someone's parent is an abusive alcoholic, the child wouldn't inherit the guilt, but might inherit some baggage from being abused. The west believes that all humans inherit the guilt of the sin of Adam. This is why the Catholic church has a doctrine of the Immaculate Conception for Mary.  Catholic and Protestants generally see the life and death of Jesus through a lens of atonement. Jesus ""came to die."" His death paid a ""ransom"" to free his followers from ""sin and death."" The Orthodox view this event differently. Since Jesus was/is God, everything he did imbued the event/artifact with divinity. For example, when Jesus was baptized the waters (and the entire cosmos) was washed with divinity. When Jesus died, it wasn't to pay a judicial punishment but to enter into death and shatter it. The act of The Giver of Life entering death imbued death with divinity - it made death be a means to eternal life.   Externally the services are much different. The Orthodox practice the Liturgy of John Chrysostom on Sundays, with very minor changes from when it was originally made in the 4th Century. Protestants, since being comprised of 30,000 denominations, have dozens of different kinds of worship services. Catholics practice Mass (and other services) but these differ from Orthodox liturgies.   Orthodox church buildings (and homes) have icons all over them. Catholic buildings and homes generally have statues. And Protestants may have either or neither. The Orthodox believe that the icons are windows into the actual person or event that it depicts. They are more mystical in general.  The Orthodox pray for, and to, those who have died. You might here a Protestant say ""Mr. Smith died last week. Let's pray for his family."" An Orthodox would say, ""Mr. Smith died last week, let's pray for him."" And they hold specific services *for* those who have departed. You could also pray *to* a dead parent, and ask for intercessions.  The books of the Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox bibles are all different, with the Orthodox bible including the most books.  I've been to Catholic mass, Protestant services of many types, and Orthodox services. I liked the reverence and mystique of the Orthodox services so much I eventually converted. After several years I went apostate and became an atheist, but I still have respect for it. If you have any other questions or want anything deeper than this very brief and general overview, let me know. I could recommend books that overview the differences as well.",comment_2,Provides clarifying comments,"Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,

NSA Director Mike Rogers was also present and said that, ""This is not going to stop or change.""^1  The question is, how should social media users and platforms (esp. reddit), along with the government as related to social media, respond?   Some context -   Propaganda has become incredibly sophisticated, and the lack of transparency and accountability on social media allows it to flourish unimpeded. For example, all of the Facebook pages (ie 'Blacktivist,' 'Being Patriotic,' 'Secured Borders,' 'United Muslims of America') that Russian troll farms made during the 2016 election to encourage Americans to fight each other and rage.^2 And rage we did.^3  There is now hard evidence that foreign troll farms have been aggressively operating on Reddit.^4,5 As the US intelligence community has said, there is no reason to believe that they have stopped or have any intention of ever ceasing operations.^6 They must be fought against at some level to save social media, which has become so important to the social fabric of America.   Social media platforms, especially Reddit, understandably rely on voluntary mods for cost-effective moderation. However, there's no transparency when it comes to moderating Reddit. Mods on sites like Reddit and Facebook are random strangers who could be anybody, making whatever rules they want, and they have the power to promote/censor any posts or comments. And the troll farms know this and are almost certainly abusing the system, along with the usual fare of bot networks and posting propagandist content.   Beyond troll farms directly controlling mod accounts, the corruption of mods would most likely happen through bribery or doxxing them and then blackmailing; things the Russian oligarchy is especially good at.^7,8  Social media platforms have so far failed to succesfully self-regulate to combat these issues. Meanwhile, the federal government moves slower than molasses, both by design and partisan gridlock. Congress and the executive branch have failed to adapt quickly enough to the Information Age, especially in regard to social media. And users' efforts have been overwhelmed by the intensity of these issues.

(I tried to keep the text of the post as un-editorialized as possible.)  It's virtually impossible for social media platforms to moderate the gargantuan amount of content on their own. They have to rely on voluntary moderation in some form. I believe social media platforms should **moderate the moderators**, and ensure that they're not abusing their power and that they aren't a troll farm (foreign or domestic.) After all, who watches the watchmen? Of course, bot networks and troll farm propagandist content should be strongly combated as well.   I believe Congress and the executive branch should work with social media platforms so that they may better **self**-regulate. They're too slow to adapt quickly enough and directly regulate social media platforms. However, this is assuming social media platforms are willig to self-regulate.   Corporate libertarianism is widespread in capitalism, but it has become an institution in Silicon Valley. Social media platforms, particularly Reddit and Facebook, have an exceptionally virulent strain of corporate libertarianism. And they've resisted calls time and again to self-regulate under the veil of freedom - wrapping themselves up in the American flag while our social fabric erupts in a great conflagration. This has been especially true with violent hate speech, particularly on subreddits like t_d.   Normally, libertarianism refers to minimizing government's role to the bare essentials, and letting the free market take care of everything else. But corporate libertarianism is applying those theories about the role of the *government* to that of *corporations*.   How does this play out? Corporations minimize their role to their bare essential function: making money. Nothing else matters, because customers and users will work out all other problems on their own. That's why they've refused to self-regulate until it affects them financially.  Of course, this is true for most businesses. The difference is that society in America is now defined by what's on the Internet, and social media platforms are arguably the most important way we communicate with each other on everything in life, offline or online. Social media has become the net supporting our social fabric. That is why social media platforms have such a large obligation, beyond financial considerations or other businesses, to self-regulate.   I'm confident many people who disagree with me will cite the First Amendment. While I fully support the First Amendment, it doesn't necessarily apply to everything in the private sector.

I think, in particular, I as moderator of a group dedicated to truth and reason, am constantly battling these forces.  The trolls and bots are one level of the problem, but there's another level too, and that's the affected, influenced masses that have become polarized as a result of propaganda.  As a result, one of the biggest problems is falling prey to what is popular instead of what is accurate.  There are quite a number of online arguments that are popular, but not scientific (For example, ""all GMOs are safe"" or ""all politians/major parties are the same"" is commonly accepted online as a socially-correct construct even though it's not scientifically sound.  I can cite more examples, but all this does is cause me to be down-voted by people who are programmed to react hostile towards certain viewpoints).  The big problem isn't simply sanctioning sites and moderators who might be propagating destructive and erroneous ideas.  It's figuring out how to educate people who are misguided.   It's finding a way to punch through peoples' biases and emotions to make them realize that, in some cases, their world view conflicts with their ultimate needs as productive members of society.  That's the big question.  The problem I run into socially these days, is the fact that people would prefer being wrong and part of the problem, yet personally comfortable, than they would being right, part of the solution, and inconvenienced.",comment_2,"Challenges Religious Customs,

Estimates of the strength of the Cult vary, but around 2 million followers seems of the right order.  I have brought many items home to Wales with me and set up my own altar, where I commune with Maria and the other members of the pantheon on a regular basis.

This has created a radically different paradigm for understanding many day-to-day events in my life, which has left me more at peace with myself and the world.

And I've often asked why he doesn't go to church or quote the bible as so many other blievers do. His reply is in the lines of that his belief is his own, and not bound to a building or a manwritten text.  It's about living a good christian life, not how much time you spend under the roof of a church or how accurately you can learn and quote the holy book.  So, there spawned a question and something that had bothered me for a long time.  Why does the holy books play such large roles in any major theology today?  It might be herresy to think how i think, but the way I see it. Any holy book in any religion is written by humans.   Human beings put pen to paper and wrote down alot of texts and some were discarded and some kept as the holy bible was constructed back in the days.","It's a letter from God to man. A letter that is written on various levels. If the Holy Spirit will show You an other point of view of any verse it will sound different. Christians should read it. If they do not do it they are like dry wheat. With no fruits.  And it is written by humans, but under Gods influence. People that were writing those books where opened to God's power and where able to recieve messages from Him.","Thankyou for your reply.  Quote:""If they do not do it (read the holy scripts i assume) they are like dry wheat. With no fruits"" I guess this doesn't appear in any holy book but rather your point of view, and thus leads me to question things even further.   I mean, if you think like that and they did think like that all those years ago.  What stopped them from implementing their own bias.   I apologize for being so blunt and somewhat direct.

One of the first stories in Genesis is about how vile the ways of the homosexuals of Sodom were. The Bible affirms the punishment for homosexual acts is execution. The new testament says that the reason people become homosexuals is because they are ""filled with evil"" and are ""haters of God"", so God gives them up to vile affections, and once they become homosexuals they cannot be saved (they become ""reprobate""). Some churches allow gay marriage, have priests that openly practice homosexuality, etc., but let's be real - these churches are going in direct opposition to what the Bible teaches.  How can the Baha'i Faith allow homosexuals to become card carrying Baha'is whereas the Bible says homosexuals are fundamentally evil and should be executed?","I don't really want to get into the Baha'i teaching on homosexuality as they are complex, but I would like to point out that Baha'is do have their own teachings for this day and age, and some of them differ from the teachings of other religions, including those contained in the Bible. In the Baha'i faith divorce is allowed for example, while it is not in Christianity. Likewise, in Islam and the Babi faith it was allowed to spread the teachings through the sword, while this is forbidden by Bah√°'u'llah. There are many other instances of this happening.","As I understand, from the Baha'i perspective, each Manifestation may change, according to the needs and capacities of humanity for His respective Dispensation, whatever law that had been established previously by a Manifestation. Consider these quotes by Baha'u'llah:  &gt; Were He to decree as lawful the thing which from time immemorial had been forbidden, and forbid that which had, at all times, been regarded as lawful, to none is given the right to question His authority. Whoso will hesitate, though it be for less than a moment, should be regarded as a transgressor. &gt; http://www.bahai.org/r/053610038  &gt; O thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon the Dawning-Place of the Cause of God! Know thou for a certainty that the Will of God is not limited by the standards of the people, and God doth not tread in their ways. Rather is it incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to God‚Äôs straight Path. Were He to pronounce the right to be the left or the south to be the north, He speaketh the truth and there is no doubt of it. Verily He is to be praised in His acts and to be obeyed in His behests. He hath no associate in His judgment nor any helper in His sovereignty. He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. Know thou moreover that all else besides Him have been created through the potency of a word from His presence, while of themselves they have no motion nor stillness, except at His bidding and by His leave. &gt; http://www.bahai.org/r/835286232  &gt; ...whatsoever He should ordain in this day and pronounce as lawful is indeed lawful and representeth the very truth. It is incumbent upon all to turn their gaze towards the Cause of God and to observe that which hath dawned above the horizon of His Will, since it is through the potency of His name that the banner of ‚ÄúHe doeth what He willeth‚Äù hath been unfurled and the standard of ‚ÄúHe ordaineth what He pleaseth‚Äù hath been raised aloft. For instance, were He to pronounce water itself to be unlawful, it would indeed become unlawful, and the converse holdeth equally true. For upon no thing hath it been inscribed ‚Äúthis is lawful‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is unlawful‚Äù; nay rather, whatsoever hath been or will be revealed is by virtue of the Word of God, exalted be His glory. http://www.bahai.org/r/963019440",comment_1,Respects Diverse Perspectives,"Respects Diverse Perspectives,

I'm normally such a strong and confident person and very few things get under my skin. It was only during the last year (and the last few weeks in particular) that I have felt completely violated and broken. I was told my whole life that I was part of the greatest organization on earth and that I was being led by the most righteous men with the truest truth in existence. I dedicated 25 years of my life to them and I now feel so abused and taken advantage of. To make things worse, I can't get my wife out with me. I am still stuck in an organization that continues to abuse me and violate my conscience. She even knows that it's not true anymore, but she is too emotionally attached and is completely stuck in, being convinced that even with all the lies, nothing could be better. I'm afraid that I'll never be able to escape this cult and I'm afraid what will happen if I am forced to stay and continue to be abused with my loved ones.

I feel like I'm in the ultimate abusive relationship and all my family is being held hostage.","You need to take your time. If your wife agrees with you that the church is a fraud you are in a better position than many other exmos.  If your wife was raised in this cult, then I can understand her reluctance to leave. Changing your entire life can be scary. Help her to learn about others who left the church and have better lives because of it.  Things may not be as bad as you think they are right now. Give your wife time to get over being afraid and let her see how much more enjoyable life can be without the church (and without them taking your hard earned money).  She may come around sooner than you think.","I had a therapist, and I spent a lot of time thinking about sunk costs.  You can't go back and get those years back. You only have going forward.   Get a therapist and work on yourself. I found Venkatesh Rao's 'The Gervais Principle' really useful in helping me understand the church and why I felt the way I did.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,12g7960,Which is the true Religion?,"Which is the True Religion?  If you say that your religion is the only path to God and that other paths lead to hell, I have one humble question for you. This question applies to followers of every religion without any trace of partiality. The simple question is: Today I have heard about your religion and if I follow it, I reach God while if I refuse, I will go to the hell for my own fault. This is very much reasonable. But before your ancestors discovered the country I come from, the scriptures or even the name of your religion was not known to My ancestors and they could not reach God for no fault of theirs. On the other hand, your ancestors followed your religion and reached God at that time. Even if I assume that My ancestors will take rebirth in the present time and will follow your religion to reach God, such a possibility is ruled out because you say that there is no rebirth for the soul. Thus My ancestors suffered forever for no fault of theirs. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that God must be partial. Had God been impartial, He would have revealed your religion to all countries at the same time. Had that happened, My ancestors might have also reached God as your ancestors did. Therefore your statement proves your own God to be partial.  Why must the partiality of God be eliminated to give way to impartiality? The impartiality of God isn‚Äôt necessary, but can be taken as true  if looking at the world from the concept of omnipotence. God being omnipotent, and thus omniscient, has no reason for partiality   The only way to make your God impartial is that you must accept that your very God appeared in all the countries in various forms at the same time and preached that only true path of your religion, in various languages. He did not appear in the same form everywhere and neither did He preach in the same language. However the subject matter was the same‚Äîdivine knowledge. The syllabus and explanations were one and the same, though the media of instruction (languages), external looks and names of teachers were different. Thus the religion that God gave to your people and country is not different from the religion that the same God gave to other people in other countries in different languages. Can you give any alternative reasonable answer to my My question other than this? Certainly not! Whenever you claim your religion to be the one and only path to God and whenever you condemn other paths, remember that any person belonging to any religion can pose this question to you.  Moreover every religion claims that their God alone created this world. Unfortunately this world is only one and every God cannot create the same world; there are not many worlds to justify each God creating His own world. Therefore any human being with an iota of commonsense has to agree that there is only one impartial God who created this one world. He alone came in different forms to different countries and preached the same path in all the languages, simultaneously at one time.  This is taken from Universal Spirituality for World Peace‚Äôs website","James 1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.","all religions are the same yet different. All serve a purpose and all were created for the people at that time. I imagine new religions will be made in the future when there is more technology and AI integrated in our every day lives. That being said, if you don‚Äôt follow the religion that doesn‚Äôt mean you are bad or will go to hell - depends on the religion. In Christianity and Islam you will be condemned, and they are more strict which I why I am not Christian or Muslim. In Hinduism if you fail your duties, are a bad person, you will be reincarnated into a form that allows you to work on your past failures/mistakes (karma). There is always time to improve because of reincarnation. This simple aspect of Hinduism for me is comforting and gives me grace. Yes there is heaven and hell, but the religion itself it more so focused on spirituality and growth with an open set of arms. I really dislike the fact that Christians will try to convert you and ‚Äòsalvage‚Äô you. Hindus will not because in the end they know you will be taken care of justly by the creator. Additionally, all gods can be true, all of us can be living in alternate timelines, reality can be a dream.

To go forward, from my limited knowledge, I would suggest to use these difficult feelings to work on your self.

What should I tell her if she ever confronts me in person?,"**Some background info:**  I love my sister with all my heart, but I've just had enough. Today I decided to do what I've been hesitant about doing. I've finally blocked her after years of arguing with her over our different Christian beliefs. We've been going at this, arguing through text (sometimes even through phone calls) on and off for over 5 years. It's also upsetting how I never once bring up the topic, but rather she does this to try and change my views (or is saying it out of ""concern"" for my life).   I've finally decided to block her because she just wouldn't stop sending me potlical videos or sending me verses of the Bible to try and debate me. The part that's upsetting is that it's all unprovoked. I don't try to argue with her because I operate on a ""agree to disagree"" basis. But clearly I'm alone with this thought, as she just wants me to change my beliefs. I either engange with her for a while but for the most part I don't entertain her. I mostly just shut her down saying, ""Stop. I dont want to argue or debate you."" And then I hit the ""Do Not Disturb"" button and ignore all of her messages after. But this ignoring doesn't seem to stop her from eventually trying to debate me a few weeks later. I've just had enough and decided to stop this temptation for her by blocking her.   **Now onto the main question:**  What do I tell her if she ever asks me about it? Because either she will confront me in person or will call our siblings/mom to try and reach me and ask me about it that way. Because even if I've blocked her, she still holds onto a close relationship with everyone else in the family. She lives just a town over and my mom basically visits her everyday to babysit the kids.   I was thinking about just saying maybe, ""I dont want to talk about it."" Or ""I have nothing else to say to you."" But I know that wouldn't shut her down. She would just say, ""No. We have to talk about it."" And then will go on and on to either continue the debate or now argue how I'm being mean to her or whatever. I don't know what to do in this scenario.","""You have shown me that you are unwilling to respect my clearly-stated boundaries. I have taken this action to protect my well-being.""  If you are open to reconciliation, you can tell her so, but make it clear that it is dependent on her willingness to communicate in a healthier, more positive way.","It's not clear if you've actually told your sister how you feel.  Texting during a ""debate"" could imply you're up for a discussion at a later point.  If you're yet to have a talk with your sister about boundaries, then this should be the first thing you do.  Assuming this chat has already been had but ignored, don't skirt around the issue.  If the time and mood is right, you should be honest with her and everybody else.  If the timing etc isn't right, tell her you love her and appreciate her company but you just needed some digital headroom, and you'll talk to her in a better and conducive setting in a day or so.

An example is when Musa prayed against Fir'awn and his chiefs, saying:  ÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸëŸéŸÜŸéÿß ÿßÿ∑ŸíŸÖŸêÿ≥Ÿí ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸâŸ∞ ÿ£ŸéŸÖŸíŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸêŸáŸêŸÖŸí ŸàŸéÿßÿ¥ŸíÿØŸèÿØŸí ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸâŸ∞ ŸÇŸèŸÑŸèŸàÿ®ŸêŸáŸêŸÖŸí ŸÅŸéŸÑŸéÿß ŸäŸèÿ§ŸíŸÖŸêŸÜŸèŸàÿß ÿ≠Ÿéÿ™ŸëŸéŸâŸ∞ ŸäŸéÿ±ŸéŸàŸèÿß ÿßŸÑŸíÿπŸéÿ∞Ÿéÿßÿ®Ÿé ÿßŸÑŸíÿ£ŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸÖŸé  (Our Lord!

Meaning, Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  Scholars have also said: ""The meaning of the Verse is: If you are in doubt, then ask, and if you are not in doubt, do not ask, for the doubter or the ignorant asks. As for the person who knows and is certain, how can he ask? In the Verse, the doubt was negated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the doubters were ordered to ask.""",comment_1,Seeks out new information,Seeks out new information,,,,,No,0.7131774749
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/religion.jsonl,religion.jsonl,5c47mp,Need advice on transitioning out of religion [Southern Baptist],"I, 25 year old male, grew up Southern Baptist all my life. The youth ministry was great and I made a lot of friends (most of which I don't keep up with, but I think that has more to do with growing up than anything). But once I graduated high school and moved into the college ministry I felt really abandoned.  The church had the college group set up in a small building, on the far end of their property, literally as far from the main church building as possible. The married couple they had leading the group were decades out of college and would generally only talk about religious history. This really bothered me because, looking back, college is the most complicated time in a young person's life and here we were talking about religious festivals and the meanings of ancient Hebrew words.  Today, I no longer go to church anywhere (except Christmas and Easter [I'm a cliche now] with my family who all still practice regularly). But, I have a lot of conflicted feelings about where I stand with my old beliefs. I feel happier now and more self-aware of myself and how I feel about the world and people, but I can't even bring myself to tell my family that I don't think I believe the same way as them anymore.  If anyone has had a similar experience I'd love to hear about how you came to terms with leaving and how you told your families.",Same here dude. Best to tell your family about it tho. It's maybe hard but I think it's worth trying.,"I don't have a lot of advice directly related to your question, as my situation was different, but I would say to be careful about your attitude towards religion as you transition. Many people transitioning religions or out of a religion entirely fall into a trap of bitterness towards their old religion. Atheists can be some of the worst offenders, or at least the most visible. Being angry about what you used to believe or disdainful of those who continue to hold those beliefs is poisonous to your relationships.  Remember the reasons why you previously enjoyed your religion and the good and bad times it helped you through. Even if religion hasn't worked out for you, it is still a force of great good for many others.   You also don't need to excommunicate yourself from that community if you don't feel that all your beliefs align. I'm a solid agnostic atheist, but I found a very supportive jewish synogogue  (sp?) that helped me survive college, even though I have no jewish heritage or belief. They knew I did not share their beliefs, but they continued to treat me as one of the community. In thanks, I did all that I could to understand their religion and volunteer within that community.  If you haven't fully defined your beliefs or are anxious about your family's response, I'd recommend fleshing out your ideas before making any public announcements. You may even consider looking for a priest (not sure what southern baptists call their religious leaders) to help you answer questions if you feel that you might still believe, but have reservations.

I take an elderly gentleman to Catholic Church every Saturday as part of my employment. I am a Bahai and I sit and listen. I find myself becoming bothered by what they are reciting because it's just so backward and dare I say it? False. I look around at all the people just repeating the same verses over and over almost robotic like. Bowing to the altar and the priest. It's just over the top.  The 2nd part to this is while I do stand and kneel as to be respectful should I join along in prayer and song or would that be discounting my Faith?,"Just keep in mind: these people are trying to connect with their creator in the way they understand and think is best. It may not make sense to us, but we need to try and recognize it for what it is.  Nothing wrong with joining in prayer and song, either! ‚ÄúBlessed is the spot‚Ä¶where mention of God hath been made, and His praise glorified!‚Äù","I wouldn't say it wrong or false but it is ordered and based on an understanding of spiritualism that we recognized to no longer need. As time goes on we as Baha'i's note that our spiritual needs as society change and the formal clergy of the older faiths is not necessary. That does not mean that there are not valid teachings or that people of the Catholic viewpoint may not have revelations that we should listen to, but it can color your interactions.",comment_1,"Respects Diverse Perspectives,

If you are asking a specific scriptural question, please include a source link and verse number, so responses can be more helpful.  In terms of introductory Hindu Scriptures, we recommend first starting with the Itihasas ([The Ramayana](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRamayana/wiki/resources#wiki_recommended_texts), and [The Mahabharata](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMahabharata/wiki/resources#wiki_resources).) Contained within The Mahabharata is [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGita/wiki/resources), which is another good text to start with. Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas & Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation.   In terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), there are many you can try and see what works for you such as r/Introspection, r/yoga, r/meditation or r/bhajan.

A fair amount of what happens to you in the course of your life is shaped in part by the way you approach things. This is especially true of that part of the world around you that consists of other people, since the verbal and nonverbal signals you give them help shape the way they perceive you, and thus the way they treat you. Even the purely material side of existence, though, responds differently to different approaches. If you‚Äôve ever gotten good at using a tool, you already know that there are productive and counterproductive ways to relate to physical matter, and your attitude and unthinking habits play quite a substantial role in determining which of these is typical of you.  _  &gt;The methods of New Thought work, in other words, because each of us is always engaged in a conversation with the rest of the world, and what we contribute to that conversation helps shape what the world says to us in response. The best of the New Thought teachings back in the day grasped that, and taught students to listen to the world‚Äôs side of the conversation; that‚Äôs one of the things that meditation does, and it‚Äôs also one the things you can get from studying your dreams, or from work with random-symbol generators such as tarot and runes. Yes, this is a part (though only a part) of what occultists like me do, and it‚Äôs also something that can be done in a less ornate way, the way the better grade of New Thought schools used to teach.  _  &gt;Turn the conversation into a monologue, and you can still get results, at least at first, because you‚Äôre still changing the way you relate to the world. There‚Äôs a trap hidden in this approach, though, and it‚Äôs called the intermittent-reinforcement effect. Psychologists found a long time ago that if you want to train rats to push a button, say, you have to give them some kind of reward for doing so, but you don‚Äôt get the best results if you give them the reward every single time. No, the most effective way is to give and withhold the reward randomly: this push of the button dispenses a bit of food, but the next two don‚Äôt, and then one does, and then three don‚Äôt, and so on. The rat ends up obsessing over the button, pushing it frantically over and over again. What‚Äôs more, you can stop giving the rat any reward at all, and it will keep on pushing the button for a good long time on the off chance that maybe, just maybe the thing will work once more.  _  &gt;Practicing New Thought methods under the conviction that you create your own reality, and don‚Äôt have to listen when the world says something else to you, is a very effective way to use the intemittent-reinforcement effect on yourself, and trap yourself in a way of doing things that doesn‚Äôt work so well. Those methods will get you some results, especially at first, when you figure out how to pluck the low-hanging fruit by stopping this or that self-defeating habit, or what have you. Those successes, like the early luck you get in a poker game rigged by competent card sharps, lure you in and convince you to keep playing‚Äîand in the same way, the longer you play and the more heavily you bet, the more certain you are of getting fleeced.....""  _  ------------------------------  _  Do you get a sense of the danger of believing you can recreate reality in your own desired image if you just *believed* or *practiced* long or hard enough?  _  Why not just call the staff a staff?  _  --------------------------------------------  _  This is what Zen Masters can do to those who seek to live fully in fantasy:  _  &gt;When the Master was in Leh-t'an, he met Head Monk Ch'u, who said, ""How amazing, how amazing, the realm of the Buddha and the realm of the Path!

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/ELINT.jsonl,ELINT.jsonl,1rn5qy,Christianity (maybe other Abrahamic religions too): Why is Christianity considered monotheistic and not duotheistic?,"From the Bible it seems Christianity is actually a duotheistic belief. It seems Satan is a god, of evil but a god still. In Corinths 4:4 it is said Satan is The God of this world. There is a very clear dualistic nature to Christianity, specially Catholic and Protestant. The eternal struggle between the two powers of darkness and light. How come this isn't duotheistic?","Here's the quote from the KJV of the bible:     ""In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.""      It doesn't specifically reference Satan (nor does it in the preceding passage), however it could be interpreted as such. In Christian metaphysics/mythology, Satan is not a god, in the sense of the Christian ""God"" (emphasis on the capitalization). By my own exegesis, I see it as more of a metaphor for the corruption of man in the face of divinity (sort of like Jonson's ""almighty dollar""). Some translations, most notably the Living Bible, translate this as ""Satan"". You could say that with this translation/interpretation in mind that yes, there are two ""gods"" in Christian mythos, but we differentiate between a ""god"" and the ""God"" simply through honorifics/capitalization. Could Christianity be determined to be duotheistic? Yes, you could argue that. However, I differentiate between the use of ""god"" and ""God"" to emphasize that while Satan, in this context may be powerful and assert dominion over a people, this control is unwarranted, involuntary and unwelcome. Theism is usually defined as the belief *and* worship in/of a deity. Satan is not worshiped by Christians.",It could be considered duo theistic for the belief in God and Jesus. While Chrisitians believe in one god and Jesus being god it can be seen as 2 gods,comment_1,"Respects Diverse Perspectives,

From my understanding they are the first trimurti, they were the oldest and first gods mentioned in the vedas. And Indra was ""king of the God's"" for some time.  Now the trimurti are Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, but Brahma has only one temple because he was cursed by Bhrigu Maharish.  My question is why are Indra, Agni, and Vayu now seen as ""demigods""?",That's just how Puranas are lol,"The Devas are not demigods. Since Deva has the same root as Deus in latin, it very clearly means the same thing from a theological and linguistic persective. Devas are gods and any children they might have fathered with mortal women would be considered demi-gods. A Greek example would be Heracles, Hindu examples include the Pandavas, for instance. A Christian example would be Jesus Christ, since he had a mortal mother and a divine father.

It's perfectly possible to believe in evolution and God.    God is separate from all human activity.  That's why we call Him ""self-subsistent"".  His existence is independent from human existence.  Humans on the other hand are dependent on God for existence.  God does not need evolution to exist.  God, being a non-human entity, is free from human processes.","Well, in the first place, God is timeless, so he didn't exist ""before"" anything.  Secondly, saying ""this has only happened way X before, so it can't happen way Y"" isn't logically valid, and is an argument from personal incredulity.

How was that squared with JS's first vision account at the time? Or did the CoC always have the other versions of the first vision? Hope this is okay,to ask here.  I just got curious about the doctrine.  I'm an exmormon but am interested in the historical differences/similarities with the two religions from an academic standpoint.,"Good question. I‚Äôm also exmo and would like to see the answer to that. I believe Emma took JS III to a mainstream Methodist church when he was growing up, and I understand he basically reset the church to the Kirtland era and didn‚Äôt endorse a lot of the Nauvoo innovations. Also, the Book of Mormon is trinitarian. But I don‚Äôt know how they would have squared the Trinity with the First Vision.","The RLDS Church under JS III and after has been very slow to assert doctrinal authority over individual members.  The Book of Mormon has several verses that seem to teach the Trinity.  Others seem to be more modalist.   I think that this has given room for individual differences of opinion in the church on this topic.  Community of Christ has a formal ""Statement of Faithful Disagreement"" that says even expressed disagreement with a basic church teaching is not to be considered unfaithful.  We aspire for there to be room in the church for everyone, including Atheists - something that has been expressed by our current President.  As far as JS, Jr.s first vision, there are 4 different accounts directly from him, plus several other people recording what they heard him say on the topic.  I think that these differing accounts were known to many of the early RLDS members, and it was discussed in Church publications.  One of my professors at Graceland College, Paul Edwards, an historian and son of F. Henry Edwards, a son in law of F.M. Smith and member of the First Presidency, has written on this topic.  By the way, Paul married my wife and I.  One of the things I have really appreciated about the church is that F. Henry Edwards and F.M. Smith were in disagreement on several theological issues but remained very close.  F. Henry's son Paul also disagreed, especially regarding Pacifism, but they never let it get in the way of their personal relationship.  Joseph Smith III was also the same, appointing counselors to the First Presidency that he had major disagreements with.",comment_2,"Respects Diverse Perspectives,

For the sake of me not passing off as some new-agey hipster who is only interested because it's something that's 'out of the box', I figured I'd give some background information.   For maybe the last 3 or 4 years I have been absolutely enthralled with eastern philosophy. I've read the Bhagavad Gita a good number of times from varying editions, read the Upanishads, read a decent amount of the Mahabharata.. I've even adopted a mostly vegetarian diet from eating meat 3+ times a day    Needless to say since I've discovered these texts I've drastically altered my lifestyle.    Anyways,  My absolute favorite text that I have read, not even just Hinduism related but anything dealing with religion period, is the Bhagavad Gita.    After reading it time and time again and noticing the small variations in translations, I've decided that I would like to learn sanskrit so I can read it as it was written.    I told myself that since I have the summer off from classes I'll devote it to beginning to learn, so I looked around for the best 'beginner' book and bought it.  Well, shortly after opening the book I realized that I have no idea how to properly pronounce these words and I would only be doing myself a disservice to put all this effort into learning only to learn it wrong; so I decided to look up a local temple and see if they offer classes, which they do.    This brings me back to the beginning. I have no idea how to go about this aside from giving them a call. What do I wear, what do I expect? Are non-hindu visitors even welcome? I know you people are not racist, but would a white person who has little to no exposure to your culture taking a trip to the temple be offensive?

There is a long standing tradition in eastern cultures, that spiritual truth is open to all human beings.

Here's a quote of him describing it in a historical and political context. [Taken from a 2007 interview]  &gt;Way back in American history to the time of the colonists, there have been eras of religious revivalism. Most recently we see this in the 1950s, which was a big period of religious revivalism. That‚Äôs how we get phrases like ‚ÄúIn God We Trust‚Äù and ‚ÄúOne Nation Under God.‚Äù  &gt; &gt;Religious revivalism picked up again in recent years. Until recent years, it was not a major force in political affairs. That has happened in the last 25 years and it is now an enormous force ‚Äì fundamentalist religion, not all religion by any means. So, for example, the U.S. has often been bitterly opposed to Christianity. That painting (points to a picture) is an illustration of the hatred of U.S. leaders for the Catholic Church. It was given to me 15 years ago by a Jesuit priest. It is a painting of the Angel of Death on one side with Archbishop Romero, who was assassinated, and right below are six leading intellectuals who were murdered by an elite U.S.-run battalion. That framed the decade of the 1980s: Romero was assassinated by U.S.-backed forces in 1980, Jesuit priests in 1989 and, in between, the U.S. carried out a major war against the Catholic Church.  &gt; &gt;Many of the victims of (President) Reagan‚Äôs efforts in Central America were nuns, lay workers, and for clear and explicit reasons, which you can see officially stated, like the famous School of America, which trains Latin American officers. One of its advertising points is that the U.S. Army helped defeat liberation theology, which was a dominant force, and it was an enemy for the same reason that secular nationalism in the Arab world was an enemy ‚Äì it was working for the poor. This is the same reason why Hamas and Hezbollah are enemies: they are working for the poor. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are Catholic or Muslim or anything else; that is intolerable.  &gt; &gt;The Church of Latin America had undertaken ‚Äúthe preferential option for the poor.‚Äù They committed the crime of going back to the Gospels. The contents of the Gospels are mostly suppressed (in the U.S.); they are a radical pacifist collection of documents. It was turned into the religion of the rich by the Emperor Constantine, who eviscerated its content. If anyone dares to go back to the Gospels, they become the enemy, which is what liberation theology was doing.","*""Liberation theology is a form of contextual theology, in which the experience and circumstances of the interpreters are given a prime importance as the first step in seeking to be a disciple of Jesus.""*  Personal summary; obviously flawed:  Liberation theology says that Jesus has been born as a specific human beeing by choice. It was his choice to live and died as a opressed minority and it was his choice to liberate this minority out of opression, just as god lead the people of Israel out of Egypt. Liberation theology claims that Jesus is not everybodies cuddle-friend, but he relates mainly to the opressed and his legacy is mainly in acting against the opressors.  Thus a christians calling is to act against the opressors and the only people that can really relate to him are the opressed. When you cannot relate to Jesus, because you have never been opressed, you will never fully get the good news. You can still follow Jesus, you can still do your best, but you simply will not get it. Because Jesus work and love is directed to the opressed, not the opressors.  &amp;#x200B;  A strength of Liberation theology is imo the focus on Jesus Christ and his love for the poor and very poor, minorities and opressed. I think especially in a time where people try to whitewash their dirty clothes (f.e. by praising a MLK that they wouldve stoned to death decades earlier) it is good to remind people that Jesus loves all of us, but heloves the weak and poor first. A hard pill to swallow for well-of white christians like me, but a truth nontheless. As a well-of white christian, I will have to eat the crumbs with the dogs I guess, but I know there is enough crumbs for eternity, lol.  A Weakness of Liberation theology are a danger of sexism in its roots. Liberation theology has been very quick to hold high issues of opression against males of color, yet lacked to grapple with the even worse situation to acknowledge the opression against (a) women (b) of color. This Intersectional Discrimination is mainly overlooked in the early works of (Black) Liberation theology and only later added on. But it still feels like an apendix to a body of work that mainly deels with male struggle. (A similar thing happened in Feminism, where there has been indeed a fight for womens rights, but no fight for women of color.)  &amp;#x200B;  I think there are more relevant fields of theology to dig into, but when you are interested in Liberation theology I can recommend it. It is very interesting to look at theology from this liberation perspective.",comment_2,"Recognizes limitations in one‚Äôs own knowledge or beliefs,

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/PCUSA.jsonl,PCUSA.jsonl,vy5pjj,Karl Barth book recommendations?,"Hi! I've been hearing a lot about how the PC(USA) is inspired by Barthian theology rather than legalistic commitment to TULIP and the Westminster Confession of Faith that you often see in the more theologically conservative Presbyterian denominations (not that there aren't traditional Calvinists in the denomination as well), and I'm curious in learning more about what the guy believed and how he inspired the PC(USA). Thanks!","The quickest, easiest way to get into this, I think, is to pick up the Book of Confessions and read the Barmen Declaration and Confession of 1967. In the PC(USA), we hold to a Book of Confessions. This Book includes confessional statements throughout church history. These are not prescriptive for membership, but at ordination, we agree to be ""obedient to Jesus Christ, under the authority of scripture, continually guided by the confessions of the reformed faith."" These include the Westminster Standards, but they also include things like the Heidelberg Catechism and Scots Confession, and they include modern confessions.  The Barmen Declaration was partly written by Barth and others in response to Nazi Germany. The Confession of 1967 was a modern confession written by others that I think shows a ton of Barthian influence.  The problem with reading Barth himself is that he's super dense. His opus, Church Dogmatics, is huge. *Evangelical Theology*, his commentary on *Epistle to the Romans* and *Dogmatics in Outline* are all shorter books, but can still be somewhat dense.  If you want a picture of Barth's influence theologically and how that might differ from traditional conservative Calvinism in practice, check out Daniel Migliore's *Faith Seeking Understanding* and Shirley Guthrie's *Christian Doctrine.* These are meant to be introductory college-level textbooks.  You might also check out writers like Eugene Peterson and Frederick Beuchner. These guys were big-time late 20th-century PCUSA figures who come from the stream of theological thinking you're talking about.  Hope that helps.","As u/GoMustard said, The Confession of 1967 is a good consensus on our denomination's use of Barthian theology. We have less theological confirmity today than I imagine we had when it was written, but this Barthian framework is still the most widespread theolgical consensus in our denomination.  I recommend *Evangelical Theology* as a first book to read. It might not feel exciting, but it's a really good foundation for an authentic but not fundementalist faith.   If you want to get deeper into Barth, I highly recommend *Epistle to the Romans* and the resource *The Great Passion* by Eberhard Busch.  Another really good place to start would actually be a recently published book called *Churches and the Crisis of Decline* by Andrew Root. It walks through the state of most mainline churches trying to navigate faith in a secular world where churches don't have the role and status they once did and pairs it with Barth's own theological journey and its historical context. I haven't finished it yet, but I can't recommend it enough. Andy Root builds on his prior *Secular Age* series, but this latest book is both a decent summary of his prior work and an excellent example of why Barth remains so impactful.",comment_1,References text from literature,References text from literature,,,,,No,0.7233891458

I offer to go one-on-one with any man from your army and you send this boy?  Who in the fuck do you think I am?  Do you know who I am and what I‚Äôve done?‚Äù  As he says this, he waves one of his massive arms in a sweeping gesture and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve killed monsters and men all across the world‚Ä¶‚Äù As he sweeps his arm, everywhere he sweeps has become what looks like a forest.  She peers into the scene without entering. Goliath is on one knee, looking at the ground.  A pack of rather large wolves are circling him.  He sees the leader and the rest of them as they make their presence known one at a time. The wolves are all larger than normal and amazing creatures, but the leader is clearly meant to be the leader.  This specimen has broad shoulders, huge paws and a set of perfectly aligned, razor-sharp teeth which he is flashing as he sizes Goliath up. Even against an adversary as big as the one he and his pack are about to take on, he‚Äôs approaching this hunt as though there was a baby fawn in their sights. The moon is out and the pack typically has the advantage with their excellent night vision.  All of them have dark colored fur which is also an advantage at night time because all that can really be seen of them are their reflective eyeballs with one exception: the leader. The leader‚Äôs black coat is so healthy and shiny it practically gives him the appearance of a ghost because it looks like it glows when even the smallest amount of moonlight is out; shimmering brightly off his jet-black fur. Unamused, Goliath stands up without drawing his sword and lunges towards the leader and is on top of him in an instant, swinging one of his huge fists at the wolf.  This blow knocks the wolf off his feet and the second blow slams down on the wolf‚Äôs head, killing it instantly. He gets down on all fours and growls.  The growl is so intimidating the pack, who have faced large prey before, leaves their fallen leader and retreats. Goliath stands, laughs and walks up to the dead wolf.  He picks it up and with one, quick motion, completely tears the head off and gently sets it down next to him. He then grabs the headless body by the hind legs into the air and enjoys a drink of fresh blood.  He gets slightly irritated when the blood stops running at a nice, drinkable pace, so with one hand firmly grasped on one of the hind legs, he places his other hand in front of it and begins to squeeze in a forward motion. He is squeezing the wolf carcass like someone would if they were trying to get the last bit of tooth paste out of a tooth paste tube. Watching some of the wolf‚Äôs inner organs and blood get funneled out the hole where the head used to be and hearing the sounds of bones being cracked is disgusting! She turns away, leaving him to enjoy his snack.  When he‚Äôs done with his drink he shakes it.  He shakes it and then peers inside it as though he‚Äôs missed something. He stretches the neck-hole open and with surgical precision, reaches inside the torso and within a matter of seconds he has what he was looking for: the heart.  Even though the wolf‚Äôs organ is no longer functioning, it‚Äôs still a healthy heart full of well-exercised, tight muscles so he has to spend quite a bit of time chewing to finish it off. Content with that course of his meal, he flings the flattened, blood-drained carcass through the woods like a chicken bone and prepares for dessert. He now turns his attention to the wolf head and pulls out a sharp knife.  With the heavy base of the knife, he delicately taps one time on the skull then peels the skull bone away from the brain like he was peeling a boiled egg. He smiles a bloody smile, looks at the brain in his hand and uses the tip of his blade to get a piece of skull bone away from it.  The piece of skull falls to the ground.  He inspects the treat in his palm for more bones and without finding any, he tosses it into his mouth.  A couple of chews through the soft, grey matter and it slides smoothly down the hatch. Meanwhile, the wolves have moved a safe distance away and are staring in his direction.  The leaderless pack has watched everything from the shadows and regrouped, contemplating a revenge attack. All thoughts of getting revenge though are squelched when Goliath cups his mouth with his hands and lets out an extremely loud wolf howl.  It was as though eating the wolf heart gave him some sort of mystical power to imitate his victim‚Äôs howl and for a couple of seconds, the couple of seconds he was howling, it looked as though his head had transformed into the head of the dead wolf. The pack notices the eerie resemblance in both the physical resemblance of their leader and the sound of his howl the giant has taken on and pause with their ears pricked and their heads cocked to the side in disbelief.  After the initial shock, they immediately retreat at full-speed.  As they fade away into the darkness, the scene returns to the battlefield‚Ä¶   David now has his slingshot loaded with a stone and is shouting something about God while running full-speed towards Goliath. Instinctively, the large warrior carrying Goliath‚Äôs shield hands it to him.  Goliath is furious and insulted.  He takes the shield and with one swing of it, he slices through the man‚Äôs ribcage almost tearing his torso in half. David is closing in on him and Ziva is in a light-paced jog trying to keep up at a safe distance.  She can feel his excitement and confidence.  So young and confident, that‚Äôs unusual, but I get it, she says to herself as she smiles from a new-found confidence. Goliath takes his shield and slings it like a Frisbee towards the Israelite army, decapitating one man, half-decapitating the soldier next to him as the shield has lost some of its momentum and lodges itself in the side of the face of the third victim who was in shock and unable to move out of the way. He stands his ground. He grabs no weapon. David is within distance and slings a stone at Goliath and cracks him in the middle of his forehead.  She knew this would happen, but she forgot about what comes next‚Ä¶ Goliath stumbles while holding his head and falls to the ground, his feet are twitching.  David immediately unsheathes the giant‚Äôs sword and says to the semi-conscious Goliath, ‚ÄúThis kill is for God!‚Äù as he slices into the giant‚Äôs neck.  Four more heavy strikes in the same spot and the head is completely severed from the body. She stands beside him as he grabs the large head by its matted, bloody curls and drags it back towards the Israelite army.  Before he can get all the way back to the Israelite frontline, they have begun to shout and attack the opposing army which has already started to retreat. David and Ziva take a break in his tent.  He is excited and just keeps staring at the head.  That‚Äôs his trophy.  He is so busy trying to prop it up in his tent, he is unaware of the presence of a very official-looking, highly-decorated army officer who has been standing at the door of the tent observing David‚Äôs bizarre ritual in silence and disgust mixed with a little bit of awe.",1.

One can learn to see those traditionally cast as ""enemies"" (such as the ones you mentioned) as responding to the alienation and deprivation caused by global advanced capitalism and imperialism (along with all the toxicities that go with it, homophobia/misogyny, etc.). That perspective involves seeing a much broader swathe of humanity as ""in the same boat"" so to speak, and therefore not ""enemies."" We can say, ""your actions are immoral or destructive or against the wrong people"" or whatever, but the ""enemy/friend"" distinction becomes more complicated. We can focus more on deconstruction the *relations* that produce enemies out of people and less on individuals or groups as evil.   It's not a complete solution, at least in my experience, but certainly a big consideration for me.",I actually have an easier time loving people with different ideologies because I know they're just as convicted of their beliefs as I am of my own and believe themselves to be doing the right thing.

Baptism essentially has two parts.  First, you are formalizing your commitment to Christ in a public way, perhaps confirming a relationship that you have long held privately with Him.  Community of Christ recognizes that you may have already made that commitment in another community of God's people and if you were previously baptized it is your choice whether or not you wish to repeat with your present understanding of its meaning.  The second part is showing a willingness to join this particular church denomination.  Baptism and confirmation also confer certain legal rights depending on the country you are located in, including the ability to represent the church in an official capacity, vote on church business in business meetings, and to be called to and serve in official capacities, if called, such as priesthood duties.  I wish you blessings on your journey, and thank you for posting here.  Anyone else who wishes to ask further questions  or contribute an answer is welcome.","[https://www.heraldhouse.org/products/of-water-and-spirit-preparing-for-baptism-and-confirmation-in-community-of-christ?variant=31843115909](https://www.heraldhouse.org/products/of-water-and-spirit-preparing-for-baptism-and-confirmation-in-community-of-christ?variant=31843115909)  This is the official resource from the church for those considering baptism and/or confirmation.  You can look at it on your own before you speak to your pastor if you prefer.  Once you speak to them, I would expect them to encourage a time of preparation and study, probably using this resource with a teacher, before you set a date for the baptism.  I think of baptism not so much as washing away of sin, but more as a public declaration of a decision to follow Jesus.  It's my understanding that we would ask someone with an infant baptism to be rebaptized before joining the church.  This was the subject of much debate about 10 years ago and I think that's where it shook out.  Baptism and confirmation are frequently thought of as a pair, but it's good to separate the meanings.  Confirmation is the sacrament where you are considered a member of Community of Christ. Some congregations would let you vote in a business meeting even before this step, but if you want to be fully ""official"" this is how it's done.  I know a lot of people that are fully active in congregations, even taking on leadership roles, that are not confirmed members.  So please, don't feel rushed.      I am not a convert; I was born in to the church, but I'm happy to answer follow up questions in this thread or in a private message.

As far as I can gather it was a lot of information memorized and first put into text by rabbis living in Europe?,"The Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem (Palestinian) Talmud are two different texts.  The Talmud consists of the Mishnah (compiled in Galilee ~200 CE under Rabbi Judah the Prince) and the Gemara (commentary on the Mishnah).  These commentaries existed separate from one another.  It was expedient to consolidate the commentaries into one legal document.  There existed a school in Israel and a school in Babylonia.  They compiled and arranged the Gemara differently.  They produced two different Talmuds, consisting of the Mishnah and different Gemara.  The Jerusalem Talmud was completed by 400 CE.  The Babylonian Talmud is longer, and was completed around 500 CE.  The Babylonian Talmud is the version most commonly utilized in Judaism.  The Babylonian Talmud was completed in Babylonia, not Europe.  The compilation was begun by Ravina I and Rav Ashi.  Rav Ashi completed the core Talmud by his death in 427 CE.  Maimonides writes in his introduction to his *Mishneh Torah*:  &gt; Ravina and Rav Ashi were the final generation of the Sages of the Talmud. Rav Ashi composed the Babylonian Talmud in [Babylonia] approximately one hundred years after Rabbi Yochanan composed the Jerusalem Talmud. The intent of both the Talmuds is to elucidate the words of the Mishnah, to explain its deeper points, and [to relate] the new matters that were developed by each court from the era of [Rabbi Judah the Prince] until the composition of the Talmud.  However, it is generally agreed that although the majority of the work may have been completed by Rav Ashi, further editing was required to produce the text we would recognize as the Talmud.  This was completed by the following generations by around the year 500 CE in the land of Babylonia.  This is when the Talmud can be considered completed.  However, it is often accepted that the later few generations of scholars in Babylonia did some minor editing and clarification (sort of like issuing a revised edition of an already completed text).  Their contributions happened before around 600 CE.  So, there you have it, the Babylonian Talmud is the product of the land of Babylonia; the Jerusalem Talmud is the product of the land of Israel.  This was not performed in Europe.","Mishnah (compiled in Galilee ~200 CE under Rabbi Judah )  1 Does the actual text written by the Rabbi Judah group exist any where?  2  Does the original Gemara from Israel exist anywhere?  3  Does the original Gemara from Babylon exist anywhere?

To believe in personal responsibility/ free will is to believe that human beings are more than the inputs of their environment. There can be no morality if our moral choices are merely the effects of causes in our reality. Why punish a man for a crime if ultimately he bears no personal responsibility?  Thus free will is the only example, that I‚Äôm aware of, of non-contingent cause (agency) and effect (choice). To believe in free will is to believe that there is something about the human experience that allows us to operate outside of our reality‚Äôs system of cause and effect, and thus we bear personal responsibility for how we use this power.  Therefore, it‚Äôs reasonable to conclude that the most likely candidate for a cosmological ‚Äúuncaused cause‚Äù would be a free agent who‚Äôs agency is truly independent of cause and effect, similar to our own understanding of our own free will.   If free will exists (granted that is an expensive premise for my argument) it is the best explanation for the ‚Äúunmoved mover‚Äù.","I've met a few quite academic atheists (philosophy grad types) who accept that their naturalist position posits them no free will and only subjective morality. It's something they accept full bore... Yet then proceed to still live AS IF they have free will and AS IF morality is objective. Unsurprising, but nonetheless disappointing, I get it tho.

But Catholics are not of one mind on what exactly these things are.  9. Not where I live.  10. We use the Bible. My favorite verse is Isaiah 40:31. I have it tattooed on my back. ‚ÄúBut those that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not grow weary, and they shall walk and not faint.‚Äù",1. to get to heaven and not to go to hell 2. it used to but now i think it's nonsense 3. born into it 4. ya its god or yahweh and jesus and the holy spirit. its 3 guys but 1 guy. it doesn't make any sense. 5. that god will punish you 6. that god will punish my enemies 7. christmas used to be solstice but now its jesus' birth.  8. ya followers of christ get to sing church songs for ETERNITY and bad people suffer conscious torment forever. 9. ya im persecuted all the time for inviting ppl to church and telling ppl they are going to hell. 10. the holy bible. my favorite part is when god sends bears to maul children to death.

Why is it so hard for modernized un-radical Religious clergy like Imams (Esp Westernized and Secularised ones) to control over Muslims and prevent human violations In fact even conservatives Grand Muftis,etc even get killed!","I pointed out in  another post at /r/ExMuslim about a Catholic priest calming down a Salvadorian family who wanted to kill their daughter who just lost their virginity and even convincing them to welcome her back with open arms and understanding (thus preventing any further violence against the girl as she came back home).  Now I chat with a Palestinian atheist on Discord (from a  Maoronite background and pretty Westernized that he even admits back at home they'd stone him to death with laughing emoticon and joking tone). He states a big problem in the Arab world is the feuds between families. I asked doesn't Islam prevent that and why can't Imams stop both side. He says that any Imam who tries to but in would be killed and not just Imams but even a Grand Mufti can be targeted for violence. I was sincerely confused, pointing out the power priests have over Latin America so much that a single priest has ended blood feuds and bishops even both prevent and ed wars in countries across the region because of their influence. In addition before Pablo Escobar, priests even convinced drug cartels and other crime groups to back off their activities temporarily or at least lessen the the extent of their crimes. Priests have protected females and children from reprisals by gangs and other organizations. And thats not counting how grdy businessmen ended up donating to charity and improving working conditions because of a talk with a local priest.  He says the Imam is not seen in the same way as the priest is in strongly Catholic countries.  So I'd have t ask why? It seems even ultra radical fundamentalist conservative religious leaders have trouble trying to prevent feuds or or  protect a teen boy who's being abused by a (hypocritically) drunk Arabic father. So much even far rightwing super conservative Grand Muftis have actually gotten killed for trying to set up peace talks at the cafe. And I don't even need to get into more Westernized and Secularized Imams who even get specifically targeted for Assassination by the PNA, Al Qaeda and other terrorists.  I thought these cultures esp Arabic nations are supposed to be fanatically devout? I get liberalised Muezzins and so on getting killed but how come even ultra conservative Mujtahids don't get followed and even get killed for **INFORMING local Muslims about verses from the Quran)?  I mean Latin America  is very nasty, even reaching Arabic levels of oppression at times esp for the most conservative regions and ethnic groups such as Peru................. Yet the priests word is followed almost like its the order of the President! Priests are even give the same reverence that a beloved Aragorn-like King!  Hell eve Nuns and other lesser ranks have huge influence on the people. A Venezuelan father next door to me actually threw out a little child when he discovers he's not a real son but the product of adultery but as as the Nun knocks on the door and gives the Nicaraguan a chat, the child is not only adopted but treated like a real blood son despite working class culture from his country seeing bastard children like spawns of Satan! Simply at the orders of a Nun! And I have many mroe stories!  So why do many Islamic cultures esp various Arabic clans still continue doing blood feuds, honor killing eloping girls, etc even when an Imam or Grand Mufti, etc intervenes (even using direct Quranic verses to prevent the abuses)? Not just ignoring a Mujtahids and other clergy but even actually killing them? Like despite their supposed religiosity, they are not just ignorant of the Quran but give no respect to the actual clergy and ut their local ethnic culture above Allah's word?  Why the contrast from other cultures like Brazil where even a gangbanger who engages in gunfight an brawls will often change their behavior in front of a priest and possibly stop their criminal behavior after spend few days at a convent with daily lessons given by the priest?  I was inspired to write this question because I was reading an article about how a Sufi Imam took a prostitute under his care and was giving her shelter and food and trying to help her reform with Islamic lessons. Days later the girl's family discovered here she was. They barged into the Sufi's home with knives. The Sufi Imam tried to protect the prostitute even quoting  Shariah laws and the Hadith but they still not just killed the prostitute but even the Sufi Imam. So I was so shocked because a typical Latino family intending to do honor killing would quickly back off and cancel any plans of violence once they see the priest at the alleged hiding place of their daughter! Once they learn the priest is reforming their prostitute daughter, they'd eve be happy, seeing it as God's intervention and forgive the daughter!!!!!",Saudi funding.,"Hey, your post is quite intensely written and assumes a lot - but I'll endeavour to answer just your basic question  &amp;#x200B;  It's because Islam places a great weight upon it's scholarship but at the same time, realises that they can still be wrong. A scholar that strived to derive a ruling and gets it wrong has half the reward of one that gets it right. Also Islam places a strong emphasis on the relationship one has personally with God. We don't have confession in Islam - if we were to act wrongly, we take our repentance to God directly and seek his forgiveness.   &amp;#x200B;  Unfortunately nowadays ignorance is rampant and the Prophet salawatullahi 3alayh spoke about how widespread ignorance will take place towards the end of times. People think they can do away with centuries of scholarship and interpret the Quran and Sunnah according to their whims and desires - corrupting the land around them. The Quran comments about this saying:      30:41   ÿ∏ŸéŸáŸéÿ±Ÿé Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÅŸéÿ≥ŸéÿßÿØŸè ŸÅŸêŸâ Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿéÿ±ŸëŸê ŸàŸéŸ±ŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿéÿ≠Ÿíÿ±Ÿê ÿ®ŸêŸÖŸéÿß ŸÉŸéÿ≥Ÿéÿ®Ÿéÿ™Ÿí ÿ£ŸéŸäŸíÿØŸêŸâ Ÿ±ŸÑŸÜŸëŸéÿßÿ≥Ÿê ŸÑŸêŸäŸèÿ∞ŸêŸäŸÇŸéŸáŸèŸÖ ÿ®ŸéÿπŸíÿ∂Ÿé Ÿ±ŸÑŸëŸéÿ∞ŸêŸâ ÿπŸéŸÖŸêŸÑŸèŸàÿß€ü ŸÑŸéÿπŸéŸÑŸëŸéŸáŸèŸÖŸí ŸäŸéÿ±Ÿíÿ¨ŸêÿπŸèŸàŸÜŸé   Calamities have appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of the people have earned, so that He (Allah) makes them taste some of what they did, in order that they may return (to the right way).   ‚Äî Mufti Taqi Usmani  &amp;#x200B;  ‚ÄòThere shall come upon people years of deceit in which the liar will be believed, the truthful one disbelieved, the treacherous will be trusted and the trustworthy one considered treacherous; and the Ruwaybidah will speak out.‚Äô It was said: Who are the Ruwaybidah? The Prophet, peace be upon him, replied: ‚ÄòThe lowly, contemptible one who will speak out about public affairs (al-rajul al-tafihu yatakallam fi amri‚Äôl-‚Äòammah).‚Äô1  1. Ibn Majah, Sunan, no.4036; Ahmad, Musnad, no.7899; al-Hakim, Mustadrak, 4:465, saying: ‚ÄòIts chain is sahih.‚Äô  &amp;#x200B;  So unfortunately youre right, in many cases, our scholars are the first to be attacked by the ignorant in society - those who have been lead astray by foreign influence, compounding ignorance and the stress of modern society. Its no fault of the scholars, and in many cases, the root problem lies not in the perpetrator - but in those who sowed discord first.

They say that Islam has been around from the beginning and that hundreds of prophets were sent all around the world to spread the message, but that it only caught on in the Middle East. Of course, anyone who is educated in the fields of history and anthropology will know why many religions began and what the social climate was at the time of their invention. They will also know that Islam is derivative of the Abrahamic faiths that preceded it and that it draws on Hellenic philosophies, as well as others. Is there any evidence at all in religious texts for this being mentioned back in the day? I would expect them to cover their bases at the time, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was. It's easy to see through the bullshit, though.",there is only one verse i can think of where 'people of the previous books' [but not called jews or christian] are mentioned. maybe that verse can be twisted for the argument since almost all religions have a book. but honestly there are so many general verses in there that they could be twisted for any argument.,"Doesn't that completely contradict the Islamic teaching of the revelations of the Prophet?  Anyway, I think the fact that several Biblical characters appear in the Qur'an is evidence enough. I'm not an expert, but as far as I know, manuscripts of sections of the Bible and Torah can be empirically dated to long before any recorded sections of the Qur'an.  The Bible makes absolutely no mention of Islam, only Judaism, on which it's based.

Under what authority did they establish these traditions?","Tradition has absolutely no authority in the church. However, tradition is important because it helps us to see how people of the past have interpreted the Bible, which would weigh some on how we interpret the Bible.","Just a quick review of scripture on the subject...  In the Bible, ""Tradition"" [*paradosis*] means *handing something over* or *passing it along,* like the way a relay runner passes on the baton to the next runner. The Bible is certainly part of the tradition we received from the apostles.  In his first letter to the Corinthian church. Paul says ""[Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and **keep the traditions** just as I delivered them to you.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2011:2&amp;version=NKJV)"" And to the Thessalonioans he says, ""[Therefore, brethren, stand fast and **hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle**](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20thess%202:15&amp;version=NKJV)... [But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to **the tradition** which he received from us.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20thess%203:6&amp;version=NKJV)""  We don't have an English verb version of ""tradition"" but the Greek Bible does:  - [Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled[a] among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word **delivered** [*paredosan*] them to us,](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201:1-2&amp;version=NKJV)   - [For I received from the Lord that which I also **delivered** [*paredoka*] to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread...](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2011:23&amp;version=NKJV)   - [For I **delivered** [*paredoka*] to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:3-4&amp;version=NKJV)   - [And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, **commit** [*parathou*] these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Tim%202:2&amp;version=NKJV)    St. Luke explicitly tell us above that what he's about to relate in his Gospel is what he received by oral tradition. Paul repeatedly refers to the stories he was told and passed on, including traditions ""by word *or* epistle"" that explain his texts and prescribe conduct. Paul also explicitly commends believers who keep the tradition, and warns against those who reject it.  Paul and the other apostles planted churches and taught them all about Jewish-Christian prayer, fasting, worship, morality and life in Christ. It would be silly to suggest that in the process he never taught them anything that he didn't later write down in the few pages of epistles we have from him today.  [Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of (his) disciples that are not written in this book](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2020:30&amp;version=NKJV) ...

Just so you know, I'm an Ex-Evangelical Christian. Currently, I would identify myself as a ""Primitive Orthodox Catholic"", though I'm still trying to understand some things. Please don't be harsh nor mean. Also, please don't be offended by my questions. I'm genuinely curious. Finally, I don't agree with Sola Scriptura, for reasons I'll explain later on, but I won't judge anyone who does.  Now, I've read a lot on the Reformation and the Five Solas. And, as you can guess, I want to better understand Sola Scriptura. I am aware that the concept of what Sola Scriptura is will depend on each denomination. Some are more radical than others, while some take more of a ""Prima Scriptura"" interpretation for it. I would actually agree more with the latter than the former.  However, for those who believe in a more radical version of it, (and I mean no offense, but) doesn't it seem almost like a paradox? I see why one might see Sola Scriptura as logical and simple. Just use Scripture. However, based on all the information I could gather from Protestant sources, it just doesn't convince me. Many use 2 Timothy 3:16-17 in order to justify it, saying that ""Scripture is complete"". However, the verse clearly says ""...that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work "". The only part that actually mentions scripture is this one: ""All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness..."". And even then the only thing it says is that it is merely ""profitable"". Profitable doesn't mean that it's the only thing you can use. My car is profitable for me to get to work, but I can also use my bike, or even go walking.   Another argument used come from citing the ending of Revelations or Deuteronomy. However, put into the context of the book itself, it only applies to that specific book, because, if we used Deuteronomy for the entire Bible, 75% of the Bible wouldn't exist, since adding anything more to what was known up until Deuteronomy would be contradicting this order. For Revelations, once again, it only applies to that specific book, since non of the Apostles ever had a clue that t¬øwhat they were writing was going to be complied four centuries later into one book.  Based on this reasoning, Sola Scriptura is more like a paradox than anything else. Yes, it sound cool and it is simple. However, Sola Scriptura itself is a tradition, which would make it even more of a paradox.  So, please understand, I mean in no way to be rude or attack anyone. I just want some clarification.  Thank you for your time.  God bless.","I‚Äôd suggest downloading the Reformed Theological Seminary app, then going to lectures -&gt; systematic theology -&gt; introduction to pastoral and theological studies and then listening to the sola scriptura section by Dr. James Anderson.

How do these differ and what similarities, if any, are there between them?  Our professors were mostly (all?) Catholics and Catholicism was shown to be the faith passed on from the Apostles. Also, many of the professors were priests and brothers, which I don't think happens in secular institutions.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/TrueChristian.jsonl,TrueChristian.jsonl,hq86ui,Bibliolatry,"I am finding this charge of bibliolatry to be rather novel in this day and age, though I doubt it is not a new invention. I have seen many use this term to charge people with 'worshiping' the Bible above God or making it equal to God, and others defend against it with the arguments for *sola scriptura* and the authority of the Scriptures.  So... That being said, my aim is to *encourage* and not to *discourage* those who read this as fellow brothers in Christ to look at the deeper issues behind this term. So let us look at what the Bible actually has to say about itself in the book of 2 Timothy 3:16-17, ""All Scripture is God-breathed \[given by divine inspiration\] and is profitable for instruction, for conviction \[of sin\], for correction \[of error and restoration to obedience\], for training in righteousness \[learning to live in conformity to God's will, both publicly and privately-behaving honorably with personal integrity and moral courage\]; so that the man of God may be complete and proficient, outfitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work."" (AMP)  Now I could post many other verses, but I think this one sums everything up nicely. I think most people would affirm this statement by God through Paul, though no doubt some take it to some extreme lengths. Scripture is God's gift to us as a way of understanding Him as our Father, and Christ as our Lord, and the role of the Holy Spirit. It educates us in the matter of salvation and to know His commands for us, and for us to learn from Him and from those He has uniquely gifted to understand His Word in various disciplines. So God uses the Scriptures to speak to us, sometimes plainly and sometimes with complexity, and can often drive us to further understanding of His will for us through it and a deeper relationship with Him as a result. This I think is the standard position for most Christians and I believe it to be the standard that Christ held when He said, ""**You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings. And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free**."" (John 8:31b-32, NLT), and also, ""**Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it is built on bedrock**."" (Matthew 7:24-25, NLT)  Now this being said, I can understand the charge of bibliolatry in the context of Jesus saying to the Pharisees, ""**You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me**!"" (John 5:39, NLT) Why would Jesus say this? I believe the context of the verses preceding Jesus discourse in John 5 after healing a lame man reveal why, ""So the Jewish leaders began harassing Jesus for breaking the Sabbath rules. But Jesus replied, ""**My Father is always working, and so am I**."" So the Jewish leaders tried all the harder to find a way to kill him. For he not only broke the Sabbath, he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal with God."" (John 5:16-18, NLT) This, I believe, helps us to understand the context of John 5:39, where He was making the case that His teaching and His miracles proved that He was from God. He was also shedding light on their disbelief and unwillingness to accept the Scriptural testimony about Himself saying in John 5:40-47, ""**Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life. Your approval means nothing to me, because I know you don't have God's love within you. For I have come to you in my Father's name, and you have rejected me. Yet if others come in their own name, you gladly welcome them. No wonder you can't believe! For you gladly honor each other, but you don't care about the honor that comes from the one who alone is God. Yet it isn't I who will accuse you before the Father. Moses will accuse you! Yes, Moses, in whom you put your hopes. If you really believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me. But since you don't believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?**"" (NLT)  It seems to me that the charge of bibliolatry is *largely* used as a defamatory response to those who hold a high view of the Scriptures as really true, infallible, inerrant, and the supreme authority from God on all matters of doctrine (*orthodoxy*) and practice of faith (*orthopraxy*). Though this is not always the case for issuing the charge either, and it can be rightly laid against those who are legalists (which I believe why the charge of Bibliolatry developed in the first place). But let me offer a different perspective. If Jesus is the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, then can it not be said that when we read God's Word (Old and New Testaments) we are really dialoguing with Christ Himself and it is actually a part of our relational experience with Him rather than some separate experience? As in John 8:31-32, Jesus stated that if we remain faithful to His teachings, then we will be His disciples, and all of His teachings have been written down in the Gospels and the New Testament epistles for us to learn from and understand. If He is the authority, the Head of the Church Body, and Truth itself then it necessarily follows that all the Scriptures that speak of His teachings, and from the Apostles who were taught by Him directly, and the Prophets and the Pentateuch that preceded them, are by extension authoritative and truthful because He is the authority and He is the Word and Truth itself and the Scriptures give testimony to Him and to His commands for the godly. The Catholic Church during the middle ages made the mistake of keeping the Bible out of the hands of the common people and thus tried to control the source of knowledge from God on the most basic things of Christian doctrine, and assume the primary authority where God and His Word was the primary authority, and because of this doctrine and the practice of faith became very skewed and legalistic and humanistic, and any real relationship to Christ by grace through faith was minimal at best throughout the European nations, which is what Martin Luther was against when he nailed the 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenburg in 1517 in an effort to restore the original meaning of salvation and of our relationship with Christ rich or poor, statesman or civilian. Consider Paul's admonition in 1 Corinthians 10:11, ""These things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us who live at the end of the age."" (NLT)  Truly though, true doctrine and true practice of faith come through our relationship with Christ Jesus Himself, who points to the Bible to teach us and admonish us, especially when we need to hear it the most. Just think on how Jesus defeated the temptations of the devil in the desert by using nothing more than Scripture itself. This is why we are to study the Scriptures, so we have ammunition and our houses built on solid rock so that the devil will not topple us. Though we should also not to become so enamored with study that we never *practice* what we are learning and to serve Him through our service to others and fulfilling the two greatest commands: Love God with all of your heart, mind, soul, and strength, and love others as we love ourselves. Orthodoxy should NOT stop orthopraxy, neither should orthopraxy stop orthodoxy, in fact both are to be held and practiced *simultaneously* if we truly wish to obey Christ in love for Him, and we can only do that in some poor fashion through this marvelous grace that He has given us through faith in Him and His promises and our willingness to obey Him. Even then we should say as Jesus said, ""**In the same way, when you obey me you should say, 'We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.'**"" (Luke 17:10, NLT)  Further resource:  [https://www.gotquestions.org/bibliolatry.html](https://www.gotquestions.org/bibliolatry.html)","People have tried to replace the Holy Spirit with the scriptures he wrote. As you noted, the Pharisees did exactly this to kill Jesus and the disciples. To which Stephen rebuked them as he was executed, saying, ‚Äúyou always resist the spirit of God.‚Äù They had the scriptures, they ‚Äúdialogued‚Äù within themselves over it, but they used the scripture Ex. 22:28 to avoid obeying Deut. 18:15, which you will probably agree was not right to do.  When you‚Äôre led by the spirit as Jesus was, there is no contradiction. It is by that spirit, not by the scriptures, that we cry, ‚ÄúAbba, Father‚Äù. Otherwise everyone with a bible would have a relationship with Jesus just by reading it, and that is not the case.  The scriptures are indeed profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness, but they cannot tell you which person to marry or whether you are called to go into missions overseas or into full time ministry. The spirit should not be supplanted by the scriptures in the name of them being ‚Äúgiven by inspiration of God‚Äù, because the scriptures can be wielded by manipulators, while the Holy Spirit cannot be manipulated.","Thank you for this post, this topic was in my heart as well, and I actually wanted to write an argument in favour of the legitimacy of the term 'bibliolatry'. Some points I wish to address:  1. Bibliolatry is not so much an attack on the high view of Scriptures, but rather *a critique of the tendency to elevate the Bible to the level of Christ himself*, and you are in danger of doing that yourself in this passage:  &gt; If Jesus is the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, then can it not be said that when we read God's Word (Old and New Testaments) we are really dialoguing with Christ Himself and it is actually a part of our relational experience with Him rather than some separate experience?   Here there is a conflation between the Evangelical usage of 'Word of God' (which almost always refers to the Bible), and the 'Word of God' as defined by Scriptures, which is Jesus. In Hebrews 4:12, we read: ""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.""   Read the context carefully: the 'Word of God' does not refer to Holy Scriptures, but to Jesus. It is not the Bible that self-proclaims itself to be the Word of God, but rather it deflects attention away from itself, to Christ. I'm not saying that the Bible isn't the Word of God, but rather that we need to distinguish between the *written* Word (Bible) and the *living* Word (Jesus). The former is subordinate to the latter.   So back to your passage. You are arguing that since Jesus is the Word, and since the Bible is the Word, reading Scriptures is relating to Christ. Yes, to some extent I can agree. We know Jesus most fully through Scriptures. The Gospels are the best representation of who Christ is. However, you are conflating the two terms together. Christ is the Word of God, but He is superior to that which reveals him. The written Word and the living Word are two different things. The former gives glory to the latter. The former does not glorify itself.   So in conclusion, no reading Scriptures should be seen as, to some extent, a separate experience from our faith in Christ Himself. Yes, we do relate to Christ through the Bible, yes, we know God most fully through Scriptures, but reading the Bible and having faith in Christ are most definitely two different things. Let us not conflate them together.   2. I fully agree with this sentiment:  &gt; Truly though, true doctrine and true practice of faith come through our relationship with Christ Jesus Himself, who points to the Bible to teach us and admonish us, especially when we need to hear it the most.    But I'd also like to add more: that Christ is superior to the Bible, and not only does Christ point to Scriptures to demonstrate authority, He also *reinterpreted* Scriptures so that Scriptures points to Him.  For¬†*all*¬†the NT authors, the OT scriptures are taken completely out of their historical-grammatical context, and used the imagery and language of the OT  to talk about Christ: Christ is the second Moses, the second Adam, the high priest according to the order of Melchizedek, the suffering servant, the serpent lifted up in the wilderness, the true manna that comes down from heaven, the rock in the Sinai desert, and the list goes on and on.   Take for example, in Matthew chapter 2, Matthew claims that Hosea‚Äôs words ‚ÄúI called my Son out of Egypt‚Äù is a prophecy that is fulfilled in Jesus. Here, if we take it in its historical-grammatical context, Matthew is claiming that Hosea correctly predicted that Jesus is the Son that is called out of Egypt after hiding from Herod. This is immediately problematized by the fact that in its original context, Hosea was *not making a prophecy at all*. Hosea was also not talking about Jesus. The ‚ÄòSon‚Äô in Hosea refers to Israel. God is faithful to Israel, and during the Exodus, God called His Son (Israel) out of Egypt.  Hosea was talking about the past! Yet Matthew seems to be claiming that Hosea was predicting the future! It is clear that *Matthew was reinterpreting the OT to point to Christ, when the original Scriptures in context does not say so*.   From here, we can see that Christ is indeed superior to the Bible. Indeed, the Bible has to obey Christ, and allow for its meanings to mean more than what their original author meant.  Christ is the *lens* by which we view the Bible.   3. The term 'high view of Scriptures' is actually an extremely loaded term. This almost always is used by conservative Evangelical/Reformed to mean their *own* view of Scriptures, and it uncharitably insinuates that everyone else who holds to a different view is somehow a 'low' view of Scriptures (and that would include me it seems!).  Yes, I do reject biblical inerrancy, but not because I have a 'low view' of the Bible. On the contrary, it is *precisely because of Scriptures* that I reject inerrancy. Scriptures does claim itself to be authoritative and inspired (2nd Tim 3:16), but it does not claim inerrancy. Indeed, inerrancy expects the Bible to be what it is not: without error in its scientific and historical claims. The Bible never claims to fulfill these criteria. I'm not saying the Bible is wrong, but I'm certainly saying that Evangelicals do impose criteria upon the Bible that Scriptures itself does not claim of itself.   To conclude, I just want to say two things:  1. The Bible should not be treated as a golden calf. We have a Word of God, His name is Jesus. The Bible, the written Word, points us to Christ, but it is ultimately subordinate to the living Word. 2. Let us stop using loaded language to describe our theological positions. I have been in Evangelical fellowships, and they often used loaded terms like 'bible-believing', 'gospel-centric' and 'high view of Scriptures'. These terms not-so-subtly insinuate that those who do not toe the Evangelical line do not believe in the Bible, the Gospel and look down on Scriptures. This is slanderous and blatantly false. Let us stop sinning against our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ with such uncharitable rhetoric.",comment_2,,Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,,,"SHOULD REVISIT THIS ONE: has a number of interesting things but it's just so long so we might've missed them on first pass

""Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:"" Romans 3:22-24   Also, in 5:9 he says we are justified by blood and in 3:28 he says we are justified by faith. I am guessing these are all kind of considered the same thing.  In Matthew 12:37, Jesus says ""For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.""

But I feel it is absurd that he has discovered a materialistic solution to the thousand years old god\-question and no one has acknowledged or perceived it\- everyone always discussing only his take on gender which is nothing special. \(I would like to write about this but I \- although I learned in  a Conservative University of Rabbinical Studies for years \- I never found any hint to this in the Talmud.  Only in Ashlag and Leiner's May Shiloah.\)  This lecturer  is acknowledging in his book /entitled Maps of Meaning \(1999\) on p. 54 /and also in a video about ‚ÄûExtravertist and Neuroticist Temperament‚Äù \(no. 15\)/ his indebtedness to Pavlov‚Äôs followers quoted by J.A. Gray, who have proven by EEG and other tools that the good\-feel hormone dopamine is created by a progress forward to a better Ideal Future vision of the self. \(Remember ‚Äúpavlovian dogs‚Äù salivating at the sight of a light signifying future meal. If ‚Äûfuture‚Äù \(goal\) is more important than other things it will create a ‚Äúdominance hierarchy‚Äù. And this is a conceptual starting point to combat anarchic leftism that claim the texts are endless interpretations \(not endless, sure\) that are only serving the powerful \(not true they are just competent\)¬†: thus creating a horizontal worldview and this relativism may cause depression. Not by chance, some important Jewish teachings claim that the Eternal has not created the physical world \(which is void of affective values, says Peterson\) but only the human future\-vision was created \(for Adam and later prophets in the Jewish Bible where we see first the promise of Moses‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe first Mashiah/Anointed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääreappearing in each generation.\) /This is explained best here by Russell Hendel: [http://www.rashiyomi.com/gen\-1.htm](http://www.rashiyomi.com/gen-1.htm)/  So the controversial new celeb \(really let us not mention his name now\) simply  omits the fact that this is done with the use of this name meaning ‚ÄúWill\-Being‚Äù¬†. \(As the Eternal /=Yehaweh/ himself explains in 2Moses 3:14, saying ‚ÄúTell them the WillBeing sent you to them‚Äù.\)  Yehaweh in Hebrew\- says the newworldencyclopedia.org means ‚ÄûTo Be‚Äù in future tense active mode.\(It would be Futurator in Latin\). Obviously an Ideal Future Fantasy. Does not exist in the present. It only Will Be being. In the Future or in the fantasies about that progressively evoluing future. Best translation would be ‚ÄúEvolution or Progress.‚Äù  So regardless of the sudden fame of this famous lecturer I just wanted to share I feel awful about his forgetting to mention his source material.

How the future tense was expressed differently in biblical times. How we lost the vowels hence an exact translation is impossible. How it is supposed to be past and present and future together. Still as we do know the past and present the only invisible part for us remains the future. The fact remains this godname has a meaning content hinting at some inner experience of an expectation  - compared to the syllable "" god"" or "" dieu"" or "" bog"" which are empty and only consensual. And even the translation 'eternal' hints at the future too. But for some reason the frequent explanations of Greek words is customary ( we are told even in travel guides that katharsis means cleaning) no Christian or Muslim preacher ever mentions that the name of god has a meaning. Imagine people would be made aware that whenever they have fears or hopes for the future  - practically always - they encounter "" god the eternal"" in their daily life.

You might also check out writing by Walter Brueggeman whose scholarship on the Hebrew Testament is excellent. Maybe Jack Spong's Biblical Literalism: A Gentle Heresy.   Another way to approach the bible is as prayer,  a process known as Lectio Divina. Martin Smith has a great book on the practice called The Word is Very Near You. In the liturgical churches there's the practice of praying the Daily Office where you pray at least twice a day (morning/ evening) throughout the Psalms on a 7wk cycle (sometimes 4wks) and the rest of the bible on a 2 year cycle in a way that is contemplative and keeps the rhythm of the reading connected to the liturgical year. If you've never heard of it, Forward Day by Day is a good place to start. Happy reading!","I second the NRSV.   I'd also suggest finding someone who knows some context around things going on in the Bible, especially the politics of Jerusalem under Roman occupation.  Then I'd read the Gospel of Luke.

Basically, I suggested that there's an actual need for a reddit community that gave support and advice to people who find that their minority status as atheists puts them in difficult social situations, but that those posts tend to get a mixed response, or simply lost in the mix, at /r/atheism.  Now that you're here, this thread is for sorting out any details that may need to be addressed concerning how this community should be run.  I'll start with two things.  1. In the sidebar you'll notice that I've put a link to /r/atheism, suggesting that questions about religious debate be taken there. I did so because I think the need that isn't being suitably addressed is mostly personal and social. If anyone has a problem with that, now's the time to bring it up.  2. Generally speaking, I'm all for laissez faire moderation, but with support group-oriented reddits, I think a heavier handed brand of moderation is called for. To that end, I think we should expect a certain standard of civility in here, and moderate out any comments or posts that don't adhere to that standard.

For the last year or so I have done a very deep dive on both the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church. Christ has led me to the Catholic Church, so I began classes after a meeting where it was determined I was well advanced in areas of faith, knowledge and lifestyle. The classes are weekly, and contain both catechumens and candidates. The classes are very surface level introductions to the faith and lifestyle. I was told it would be too early for my profession of faith and Confirmation, and that‚Äôs truly disheartening.

Young Earth Creationism, I'd probably vote no.  Denying the efficacy of pedo-baptism and holding only to credo-baptism--- I'd probably vote no.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/GodlessWomen.jsonl,GodlessWomen.jsonl,pzur9,"New to Godless Women, Thought I would Share My Perspective","For the majority of my life (until around 3 years ago) I was fundamentalist Christian. Most of my experiences with sexism stem from this time period. Roles for women were clearly defined as submissive and sex was prohibited and never talked about except in mostly derogatory ways. All of the adult women were stay at home moms and women were not allowed to teach anything above elementary school. When I found 4chan in college, it was like a breath of fresh air. I had never heard anyone express their basest desires and downfalls so candidly before. This, of course, led me to deconversion and the atheist movement fairly quickly. I became active in the atheist movement on campus, and enjoyed it.  I hear stories about sexism in the atheist movement, and I feel very sad that that happens. However, I feel like most people that talk about the gender gap overlook the most glaring issue: religious demographics.   According to [PEW](http://www.pewforum.org/The-Stronger-Sex----Spiritually-Speaking.aspx), women are about 10% more religious than men. The problem goes much deeper though. **It is much harder for women to leave church than men.**  Like the post earlier, churches treat women differently. When I deconverted, my pastor found out through facebook and called my parents to excommunicate me through them. Because I was a girl, I was still under the ""head of the household"" aka my dad, who was in charge of my spirituality. I purposefully waited for over a year to come out or be involved publicly because I knew this would happen. **women have a higher risk for leaving the church because their decision is more likely to be more difficult and affect other people very publicly and personally.**  In addition, churches (to the disdain of Driscoll) can be very women-centered even if they are not woman-led. for instance, if you are a female active member of the church you often have volunteer responsibilities such as sunday school teaching, soup kitchen, women's bible study, hospice, etc. Women in marriages or relationships will be strained because the husband might feel failed in his ""spiritual leadership."" When I was a Christian, all of my close friends were made at church. I lost ALL of them.  It was a very hard thing to go through.   I know that a lot of these issues affect men as well as women, but I can't help but think that many of the absent women in the atheist movement simply haven't deconverted yet or are afraid of coming out to their families. Conditioned to be submissive for years and years, I have found that I am impossibly behind in leadership skills and visibly standing up for my beliefs. Leaving the church is one of the hardest things I ever did.  TL;DR- Sexism in the religious community largely kept me (and possibly many others?) from joining the atheist community more than anything, by way of submitting to the male influences in my life over rational thinking.   Thanks for listening","I keep hearing about women being absent from the atheist movement and all I can think is, maybe we don't want to be part of yet another movement. I for one know many women who have been atheists for most of their lives and have never felt the need to be ""active"" or part of a group and attend meetings or seek out leadership.Those are things I personally want no part of, why would I want to mostly recreate a structure like a religious organization when I am interested in just being a free thinking, independent person. I really don't understand what people are really referencing when they talk about an atheist movement or how it is ""led"" by white men. If it's being suggested that we all show up at a certain time with books by Dawkins or whoever I say no thanks. I think a lot of women are choosing to be ""absent"" because they don't want to recreate a patriarchal group they just want to be left alone, like me. It just seems that men are the ones who are obsessed with creating hierarchical groups whether it's saying that a preacher or imam is more ""holy"" or someone like Hitchens is more "" atheisty"" and I think enough is enough. It's great that people want to talk here on reddit about their experiences and questions but I wish they would shun these ideas of hierarchical movements altogether.","If I had to choose between my freedom and my family &amp; friends, freedom every time!

I don¬¥t want to do any harm but also want to have peace in my mind and soul.  What do you think?","Well, first of all, nobody ""likes"" abortions. Pro choice people are not in favour of having abortions, but in favour of giving a pregnant woman a choice.   You have no obligation of ""helping"" women have abortions (what you mean by that, I'm not quite sure), if you are uncomfortable with it. This seems like the best choice, because, as you stated, you are not harming anyone, and you have a good conscious. If this is an issue you'd like to stay out of, you have every right to. You are not taking away anybody's rights, so I'm cool with it.","As long as you are not in the medical field and refuse to help a woman who needs immediate abortive services, then by all means, don't ""help people who want to have an abortion."" It's when doctors and nurses put the life of a fetus over a woman that the ""not wanting to help"" thing gets in the way. Otherwise, you're fine. If you can think of a way to show compassion for a friend after they have an abortion, know you are not condoning the act, just being a good person.",comment_1,Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,,,,,No,0.1050228505

I'm aware that many (but not all) in the early Church were pacifists - though certainly there were centurions and active military in the Roman ranks as well.  Obviously the Just War Theory arose with Constantine and Christianity's explosion of growth  When I see the war in the OT and the absence of direct calls for pacifism throughout the Word, I view Christian pacifism with some skepticism.  Don't get me wrong - I think pacifism is compatible with Christianity, just not a moral mandate.  I respect individuals like Tolstoy and various Christian peace churches, however, I believe Jesus only asked us to engage in non-violence within our communities.  As a result, he definitely taught to avoid confrontation and revenge in everyday life, but he never once rebuked a centurion for his very lifestyle even though he had many opportunities.  Furthermore, we know from Romans 13 that the State has the right to punish evil-doers.  In order to carry out justice, it requires police, and police must use force (violence) to arrest serial killers whom are unwilling to head to prison.  Similarly, a military must use force to protect the least of us from genocide.  I think there are many non-violent options to protecting people, but at the end of the day, non-violence could not have stopped the Third Reich from destroying all that is right and good in this world","Christ's ethic of pacifism, as seen in the Sermon on the Mount, involves unending forgiveness, a willingness to turn the other cheek, a willingness to ""suffer evil"".   What Christ calls for in the Sermon on the Mount is so extreme, as to not be possible. (Do you cut off the part of your body that causes you to sin?)  But, at the same time, can we dare ignore it?  Since it is so extreme, it is an impossible ideal for a society.  Yet, it is a powerful ethic calling on police to seek ways to solve situations without violence, calling on nations, societies, and individuals to live in peace, calling on people to tolerate, forgive, love and accept those who are different.   Christ also refuses to punish, but rather Christ stands up for the criminal, including the adulterer in John 8, the thief dying beside him on the cross, and even Barabbas the murderer set free in his place.  I see this as a call to reevaluate how we think about and treat criminals.   Non-violence and non-punishment need to be held up as way of life, and taught in our churches and our schools.","I'm not arguing against the idea of non-violence as a preference, but you agree that sometimes use of force is necessary to stop evil, no?",comment_1,Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,,,,,No,0.7354230969
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/TheologyClinic.jsonl,TheologyClinic.jsonl,86ryz5,The awareness of sin,"""Only Christians sin"", said [Karl Barth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth). In other cultures there is no awareness of sin. The citizen is viewed as impeccable as long as he/she follows the rules and submits to the [social pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure).  Yet, the awareness of sin is in decline these days. Instead people think they can be ""perfect"" by adopting some [postmodernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) ideology and saying the right things. It implies a regress to pre-Christian morality. In Roman times, perfectness was the ideal, because people really thought they could be without faults. It gave rise to the motif of defending one's honour. Of course, anybody who thinks that he is perfect is also easily offended. This caused a lot of strife in society, and it could even lead to murder. Alternatively, the offended party committed suicide, as in the case of [Lucretia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia).  Augustine attacked this way of thought and explained that no human being can be stainless and free of faults, as we are all polluted by [original sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin). We are easily tempted to do the wrong thing, and much prone to error. In fact, the only way to minimize missteps is to remain self-critical and keep a watchful eye on oneself. The realization that we are all sinful helped to improve the social situation. It also introduced the concept of self-betterment. People who are perfect cannot improve themselves, but a Christian can always seek betterment. This allowed for personal growth, not only in the moral sense.  But today, due to the dilapidation of Christianity, ancient honour culture is on the rise. Postmodernism builds on Rousseau's creed of the [noble savage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage). It means that a human being is complete and perfect in his/her natural state. It causes moral stagnation, because people need not seek improvement, nor must they maturate as human beings. Humanist ideology (""Man is the measure of all things""), arm-in-arm with Islamic honour culture, leads again to continual strife in society.  [Mats Winther](http://mlwi.magix.net/)",This is a nonsensical oversimplification. What causes Oedipus to blind himself?,"I am discussing awareness of sin, not our instinctual aversion to incest. Oedipus murdered a man. He didn't see this as a problem until later.  However, Oedipus was not a man, but a fairy tale figure, which explains his naivete. This kind of incestuous hero is common in mythology, and he always suffers demise. All heroes must die; they rise like the sun, and then they inevitably go down in blood (vid. M-L von Franz).",comment_1,Condescending Attitude,Condescending Attitude,,,,,No,0.7869253189

The first two insights: recollection of past lives, on and on into the incalculable eons of the past; and witnessing the faring of beings according to their kamma. Rather than seeing the operations of the cosmos as being something fundamentally beautiful or perfect in the sense of an astonishing mathematical process, the Buddha sees it from the subjective aspect of it being a beginning-less flood of phenomena, all of which were marked with the quality of dukkha, of stress and suffering. It was his knowledge and vision of rebirth that led him to realize the ending of dukkha--and that alone is the *summum bonum* from which the Buddha's teaching derives its worth.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.1228640942

But I am frustrated with myself coming across the same type of guy. I currently have a bf (who is Christian or course) , and he is very loving, hard worker , and we get along well. The pattern I continue to notice is that they tend to not ‚Äúplan ahead‚Äù for things (example: planning for a future home, saving etc). I am not trying to uplift myself but I am 31, and I am financially stable , ready to buy a home and have children, but the boyfriend I always have either live with their parents or are in massive debt or don‚Äôt have savings. Sometimes I feel as if they are looking for a woman to help them in that area, but I just get so frustrated because I have been taking care of myself on my own for such a long time, and for once I would like to be able to be on the same page for the future with someone else. I also reflect on myself and ask myself if I need to change the way I think. I have asked God to reveal the condition of my heart, if I am the problem.  But I just get a little frustrated being the one that has their future in mind and plans ahead.","As a woman in her 30's who has been financially stable and independent for the past decade, I understand this feeling well.   At the end of the day, you want to be someone's wife, not someone's mother. Nothing good will come out of you forcing yourself to marry someone who isn't willing to step up and be a leader. And it's not about also forcing yourself to take a backseat and stop being independent, but if you're going to be a successful team with someone, you need to be on the same page.   I know men will complain that women only want guys who make six figures, but I would imagine that most of us just want a man who is responsible with money, regardless of how large the paycheque is.   Are you dating men who are also in their 30's? Nothing wrong with dating someone older who is more established. I would hope - by 40 - that he has at least moved out of his parents' home (barring exceptional circumstances).",Correct!

As expected it started with them saying that their opinions are more valid because they have had spiritual confirmations of their beliefs. They know things to be true, and that because there are blemishes on the church (orchestrated by people, but never by god) doesn't make it less true.   In general I expected this, and that to this viewpoint logic doesn't matter all that much. What was scary to me was that they were okay with all of the following:  1. Huge inconsistencies with the first vision. It didn't matter that the details directly contradicting each other. It happened, because they know it happened.  2. Belief is as important as fact. An emotion that had, and felt good about; holds as much weight as the fact that water boils at 212 degrees. You can rely on both of those ""facts"" with the exact  same amount of confidence.   3. The priesthood ban was completely okay because it reflected the culture at the time. And that sometimes we have to ask for things that we want before God will give them to us. So the leaders had to ask for God's permission to allow everybody to have the priesthood.   4. Doctrine can absolutely change to fit the needs of the culture. Not policy, but doctrine absolutely changes to fit the needs of the culture. This doesn't mean that God/religion is just a reflection of our culture/beliefs; but that God changes his rules to fit our society/culture.   Point #4 made my jaw drop, and I got sick trying to understand that thought process. And that is definitely isn't what I was taught while in the church. Or what I taught while I was on a mission. Doctrine was never supposed to change, not ever. Our church was supposedly unique, because our belief system never changed and it came from God directly.  It was really scary to see mental gymnastics in action. I hope that I was never that bad, but I might have been at one point.","No 4 actually happened? Yikes.  To back you up, your assessment of that topic is the same as mine. I was always taught God never changes, so why would the doctrine? At times policy dictates when you follow doctrine, like polygamy, both ancient and modern. But the doctrine itself doesn't change.  But the racist priesthood ban was only policy, not doctrine.

It kind of struck me as odd that the protagonist in this comic was was using the Bible to actually shut a woman up, despite being an atheist.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/OpenChristian.jsonl,OpenChristian.jsonl,rf7yyq,Who do you trust when leaving Evangelicalism behind?,"Hi, so this is my first post here. I don't know who else to talk to I guess. (so I'm going with random strangers on the internet? oh well, here goes...) I have been in conservative evangelical churches my whole life, (I'm a 39 yo man) and just a few months ago I left my Baptist church and joined a more liberal/moderate United Methodist congregation. In some ways, it is great! I love church, I love not having to hide what I think about LGBTQ people, gender equality, and racism. We have a few new friends, and they are great. But I make friends slowly and trust slowly by nature. And it's like, everyone I ever trusted for advice before, about how to be a man, how to be a husband, how to overcome sin in my life and feel at peace with God, I left all of them behind. I don't have any ill will towards them, but I still feel like I can't go to them with anything anymore.  I am afraid that their only answer to any problem I present to them is to change my theology and go back to who I was before. You know, just believe right and everything will be OK. I can't go back to that. I feel all of what I used to believe about who I was supposed to be as a follower of Christ is shaky now. So who do I go to now? How do I even live?   I could go to my pastor - he's great. But. I would have to explain all this about my past, and about my current problems, and about what I'm trying to get out of. It sounds exhausting.  Will he even get it? or do I just need to start plugging in, getting involved, and see if I figure it out?   I probably need counseling. But I worry again about being understood. If I go with a Christian counselor or therapist, will they support the new direction of my faith? If I go to a secular therapist, will they understand my faith at all? Again, translating and explaining all of this sounds exhausting.    I feel like I am floating, without any connections to anyone anymore. It's so lonely. how can I even say that? I have my wife, and my friends at church. I just don't have any confidence of being understood and accepted, even by them.    I guess what I am asking is this: if you no longer consider yourself evangelical, how did you replace all that? How did you develop new mentors, new resources, and new pathways for living out your faith?","&gt; I could go to my pastor - he's great. But. I would have to explain all this about my past, and about my current problems, and about what I'm trying to get out of. It sounds exhausting. Will he even get it? or do I just need to start plugging in, getting involved, and see if I figure it out?   Yes to all of that.  It's possible but extremely unlikely that you're the first ex-evangelical your pastor has ever met. I spent the first 20 or so years of my life attending SBC churches. My story is different from yours, but I'm sure we'd understand each other right away. Your UMC pastor has likely worked with many ex-evangelicals before (and who knows, maybe that's what they are too...). Your story will be unique, but your pastor likely knows the culture and the basic outline of your story. He'll get it. And if you're a regularly attending new member, I'm certain he would really love to get to know you better.  Also, you're probably not the only ex-evangelical in your congregation - your pastor can help you make connections with other people in your church.","Hello internet friend!   This isn‚Äôt really my background, so I can‚Äôt speak directly to personal experience. But, know that your struggles are being heard and these thoughts are very valid! You are doing a brave thing to step into a new and different space, and as you‚Äôre pointing out, even if it‚Äôs a good and healthy transition, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs without pain or difficulty.   I can comment on one detail, which is that I see a secular therapist and she is very understanding of my religious background. I have no idea what her faith background is, but she knows that my faith is an important part of my life and helps me to constructively deal with church stuff. So I would say, it‚Äôs possible to find someone who can be helpful but not necessarily push a faith identity.   That said, yes, it is lonely. I do believe God is with you, and I do believe you will start to make connections with folks in your new church and other areas of your life. However, no doubt, it is incredibly difficult to start ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù after having layers and layers of connective tissue in your ‚Äúold life.‚Äù The best I can say is to be gentle with yourself and your needs. That both means, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for hanging out with old friends even if you can‚Äôt get behind their theology and also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for setting boundaries and telling folks that they‚Äôre unwelcome in your life if they can‚Äôt respect your boundaries. And, don‚Äôt be shy about forming new connections! It‚Äôs so important to walk with others on this journey of life.   So main advice I guess is to just sign up for stuff. Show up and keep being yourself. God will be with you and hopefully show you the way to new connections.

Set aside at least 15-30 minutes for the following:  1. **Choose a text.** The Blue Cliff Record or the Book of Serenity may serve as good introductory texts for the practice. Start at the beginning of the book or case and plan to continue it in subsequent observances, without jumping around. 2. **Take time to quiet yourself.** Take slow, deep breaths. Repeat a word such as ""void,"" ""zen,"" ""Joshu,"" or ""cat."" Focus on a candle flame or an image or icon such as a painting or enso if it is helpful. 3. **Begin reading the text slowly and in a soft voice.** When a word or phrase strikes you, stay with it. Allow it to linger with you. Repeat it as often as seems necessary. There may be no apparent reason why this word or phrase has stuck out, but allow it to take root and speak to you as you recite it in the same slow rhythm. When you become tired of doing this or begin to be distracted, move on and continue reading until another word or phrase strikes you, then do the same. 4. **Conclude your reading with a prayer of thanksgiving.** Express gratitude to Bodhidharma for the gifts of this practice and in your life. 5. **After ending your prayer time, journal about the experience.**",Nice post.

It‚Äôs been a long journey, and through it all, iv come to understand and experience the Gospel, that I am saved by grace through faith, that in Him alone am I justified, perfect and righteous.  But it‚Äôs for this reason that iv been feeling a deeper and deeper disconnect between myself and the church I was introduced to Christ through...  Let me make one thing clear; I love my church.

I hate my church‚Äôs culture, and I hate what it‚Äôs people accept. Paul says that we are *anathema* and estranged from Christ if we believe that we are justified by our works, but my whole church‚Äôs culture is built on it.

And we‚Äôve been devastated by influential leaders in the past who‚Äôve influenced us to accept heretical teachings about needing to be sinless before Jesus returns.  I hate it!

After my girlfriend of nearly 4 years, to whom I was going to propose in a matter of months, broke up with me after I discovered she had been emotionally and physically attached to another man, I kinda lost it.  I did really well my first couple weeks. I had started running with my brothers in the Christian co-op I lived in to get in shape and take my mind off my ex. I was memorizing the entire book of James in a practice of discipline and thirst for knowledge. Then about a month later, I crashed. I started drinking 6 days a week (heavily at some times but mostly just two beers or a shot of whiskey), fell back into my struggles with pornography, and eventually started sleeping with a girl, with whom I am still sleeping with to this day. My well has run dry and I'm finally starting to die of dehydration. I decided to listen to a sermon by one of my old favorite pastors, Chip Ingram, and it cut deep. Out of James, the book that I strove towards so fiercely, he ushered the Holy Spirit in to tell me that I have a lot of filthiness and rampant wickedness I needed to cast aside. I am tired of going to church on Sunday with a smile, looking at myself in the mirror, and then going to bed with this woman, who loves me so dearly and I her, forgetting what I look like.

Personally, I define it as view used as a guiding point for cosmic purpose, a way of viewing the universe, your self, and others.   Basically, Deism is fairly fluid and not really any set dogma, but here's the basics:  - Belief in an intelligent Creator or Creators based on reason and observation of nature rather than faith and/or supposed glossolalia.  - The order and complexity of nature and the universe make evidence of an intelligent Creator(s) self-evident.   - The Creator(s) full nature is almost incomprehensible due to the current limitations of the human mind and language.  - Reason, knowledge, and conscience should be used in finding good moral principles.  - Human beings should be free to find the Creator or Creators in their own way as long as they do not hurt themselves or others.   I use the term Creator because, well, we're not really sure what being created the universe, it could be a variety of things and there are many theories within the Deist community. Some think of the universe as some sort of grand experiment in creation, others think of it as a massive three-dimensional painting that's playing out.   Basically, the mostly agreed evidence is that the Universe is extremely intricate and shows evidence of intelligent design and while a godless paradigm is possible, it's not the most probable origin of the universe.","My mentor reffers to 'The Creator'/'The Creators' as 'Spirit' and it seems similar to this method.  An interesting, view point.","I don't think the complexity of nature requires a creator.

It was initiated by a self-proclaimed prophet in Sweden by the name of Erik Jansson, who butted heads w/local authorities in Sweden in the 1830s-1840s as he gathered a following to build a 'New Jerusalem.'  *Jansson came to break with the teachings of Luther and Arndt. By 1844, he claimed to be a true* [*prophet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet) *speaking the word of God. Jansson wanted to create a ""New Jerusalem"" to await Christ's coming and the Millennium. He alienated Rev. Risberg and many others in the state Church, who came to question his sanity. Jannson believed in the supremacy of the Bible and his own revelations, and beginning in 1844, publicly burned the works of* [*Luther*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) *and others and urged his followers to do likewise ...*  *After repeated brushes with the law in Sweden, and having outraged the hierarchy of the Church of Sweden, Jansson sailed from* [*Oslo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo)  *for the United States in 1846, under an assumed name and condemning his homeland to eternal damnation. About 1,200 to 1,500 followers sailed him across the Atlantic Ocean ...*   *Jansson arrived in New York in June 1846 and with the help of 400 of his followers who had survived the journey, founded the* [*Bishop Hill Colony*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Hill_Colony) *in* [*Henry County, Illinois*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_County,_Illinois)*.*  Jansson was killed in 1850 (six years after Joseph Smith and six years before James Strang; all three shot and/or beat to death) and his followers expected him to rise on the third day (which he did not.)

So I recently de-converted from Christianity, and to be honest I didn't feel much (this was almost a year ago). I was a very nominal Christian at that point. I wanted to be actually honest to myself about the prospects of Christianity being true and moral, and when I looked into it, I rejected that claim. I felt fine about it then (still haven't told my Evangelical parents though). Recently, however, I feel like my ""soul"" has been hurting. I have always struggled with making friends mainly due to historical anxiety and introversion. I consider myself more of an extrovert now actually, but I don't really have many friends or a community. Moreover, I don't have a community with purpose. Religion provides this. In addition, I have no real meditation or prayer practice with a legitimate foundation. I mean, I can pray- but to what? I can meditate- but on what? What sort of humanist or atheistic philosophy can provide grounds for these practices? It seems cheap to me just to ground them on the basis of health alone, although they certainly seem to have health benefits. I feel a need to pray to and meditate on a transcendent God, not just to pray and meditate to some vaguely-defined force or power. I feel the need to have a worldview that puts these practices at the center, or assigns a purpose to them that connects with other aspects of my life, if that makes any sense. Paradoxically enough, as a nominal Christian, for YEARS I didn't even pray or read the Bible. I was actually embarrassed by prayer and church, because many of the practices I had grown up with just seemed illogical and strange! And meditation? I thought it was just some weird hippie thing, or an Eastern religious practice that I wasn't interested in. Yet now that I left Christianity officially, I feel this need. I have investigated faiths such as Islam, Buddhism, and the Bahai Faith, but there are at least a few questionable doctrines associated with every faith I've investigated. How can I find a spiritual home?  TLDR: Religion provides community with purpose, a (supposedly) legitimate foundation of meditation and prayer, and a philosophy of transcendence. How can I find these things without accepting unrealistic claims, dogmas and doctrines found in many established faiths?","I understand the situation with praying as it is very directed so would feel strange but with meditation, you don‚Äôt have to be doing it tied to a religion.  Without a deity figure or religious texts you don‚Äôt have a reference for your morality as you would while religious so meditation can be a good time to ask yourself about your personal morality.   You might find that elements of your cultures views don‚Äôt site right with you or have had a bad experience that day and it can be helpful to have the time to evaluate how you wanted to react to the situation based on your personal beliefs and values.  You can also just use the time to do more typical meditation and just take the benefits of some quiet time where you clear your mind and calm yourself at some point in the day.

Recently, I've been feeling a disconnect from my faith and am struggling with an intersection in my spiritual life (but that's a discussion for another day). I have always really enjoyed taking some time every day for Bible study and reflection, but I also tend to hold myself to it a bit better when I have something to guide me (and it also prevents me from either hitting the random page button or from reading the same passages over and over again without really learning much.)   However, in my (extremely limited) experience, a lot of devotional material tends to be pretty mainstream Christian, which is to say, fairly conservative. Since that's not my brand of Christianity, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a similar resource that's geared toward a more progressive audience?","Look up Common Prayer by Shane Claiborne.

I'm a non-Muslim following another (regular) mystical path under a master, but I am attracted to many aspects of Islam (Sharia, Tawheed, Sufism, Zikr, devotion, duality-nonduality, etc.). I looked into this question previously, but I could not find a satisfying answer anywhere. I know that Prophet Mohammed said that there is no difference between people except by piety (though this I also find somewhat problematic without explanation, but relates to the question), and that Allah has said in the Quran that ""if you believe Heaven belongs to you alone, wish for your own death, if you're truthful"" against the Jews, who believe they are the ""chosen people"" of God.  My question relates exactly to this. How are we to believe Allah that Jews are not the ""Chosen People"" of God, when the Quran admits that the Jews were indeed the Chosen, but due to their shirk and sins this status was removed from them?   To me, this says that Allah has chosen the Jews, and then the gentiles were a ""second choice"", an ""alternative"", and previous to the Jews, disregarded.   I know exactly what you're going to say about this ""disregarded"" part, namely that Allah has sent prophets to every people on Earth, and that it is said that He doesn't destroy a nation before He sends a prophet. Yet, what do we find in the Quran? We find that it is almost exclusively, only and solely, Jewish prophets are being described and discussed, their stories are being corrected and brought back to their original form, and there is hardly even a mention of any other prophet (even though clarifying the stories and teachings of other prophets would have been an immense evidence and benefit for Islam). Some say that Idris could refer to ""Hermes Trismegistos"" and some say that the Buddha is indirectly mentioned, but nevertheless these prophets play no part in Islam at all. Going to any Masjid, going to any Shaykh, these people will not come up as anything significant, but Musa, Ibrahim, Isa, and others will be mentioned and are significant in Islam, all of these pointing in the direction of the exceptional nature of the Jews, proving that indeed they are, or were, the ""chosen people of Allah"", and we are merely a ""second choice"", an ""alternative"".   I have a hard time accepting this, because I do not believe in a partial Allah, but in a universal one. If Allah were to be partial by having a ""chosen people"", that would question His justice which is unquestionable and spotless.","Firstly, The Prophet Ô∑∫ didn‚Äôt say piety, it‚Äôs **Taqwa**, two different words.  Secondly, this whole ‚Äúchosen‚Äù thing was made up the jews, **that‚Äôs why** they‚Äôre wrong (Kuffar). Allah swt chose most of his Prophets from the jews (race) and not even once did The Prophets claim such specialty, let alone the normal people (jews). Allah swt chose his Final Prophet from the Arabs, does that mean Arabs are the chosen ones now?   Also, who said that every Prophet should be mentioned in the Quran? As Zakir naik once said; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a book of **Signs**, not a book of science.‚Äù   Lastly, yea I agree with you a God cannot be partial. You actually knew it but why did you still believe that the entire ‚Äúchosen jews‚Äù thing was true? the cursed Iblees is mentioned more than The Prophet Muhammed Ô∑∫ does that mean anything?

First, if you‚Äôre a podcast listener, Fr. Thomas Hopko has all the answers you need: [Remarriage in the Orthodox Church](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/speaking-the-truth-in-love/id274245205?mt=2&amp;i=1000421715993)   I think you‚Äôve misunderstood. Fr Thomas goes into this but here it is: there‚Äôs no ‚Äúmax three marriages‚Äù thing. We view marriage not as ending in death, but continuing on. St John Chrysostom exhorted a young widow not to remarry if she could, because if she wouldn‚Äôt share her marriage bed while her husband was alive, how much more so now that he‚Äôs with God? [Letter to a young widow](http://www.clerus.org/bibliaclerusonline/en/hi5.htm#b) The three marriages polemic is misrepresented from the historical case of one emperor. It‚Äôs polemical.   Our view of marriage is one, only one, on either side of life or death.   But there are times of need when this isn‚Äôt possible. These are all individual pastoral situations. As Fr. Thomas says, a second marriage for any very good reason where the individual has grown and repents of any contribution they‚Äôve made to the dissolution of their first marriage would be taken to the bishop for permission, and this very rare second marriage would be different and more penitential than regular marriages. You see even in secular society that people who enter into second marriages treat them differently. Women won‚Äôt buy a wedding dress, or they‚Äôll only invite immediate family. It‚Äôs a natural human impulse, and I feel that in all ways Orthodoxy is extremely human, because it‚Äôs the Church Christ founded, God-made-man, as a way for mankind to come to Him.   Yes, we are one, and all of our local Churches are like this.   This is a fringe issue if you‚Äôre considering Catholicism versus Orthodoxy. Are you in communication with local priests about your questions? Are you attending liturgical services? Honestly, a bit of advice, Catholics like to get hung up on really niche pastoral issues, and sometimes the community faith life reflects this reality. We live and celebrate as relevant to us today the ecumenical councils and the lives of the saints from all ages. Catholics are very into modern developments in their religion and don‚Äôt focus as much on the ancient Church or saints with foreign names. They‚Äôre into modern apparitions, modern papal developments, and church rules and bureaucracy. I remember as a Catholic trying to explain saints to my skeptical Protestant friend. I said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs when the pope declares them holy because they‚Äôve performed two miracles.‚Äù No, doofus past me, saints are holy people in heaven. There‚Äôs so much fog, they have trouble focusing on the heart of the faith. Holding a minor pastoral issue as a stumbling block between the churches is this same fog. Ask yourself, what was the role of the pope in the early church? What is the correct theology of the trinity? What is the correct and ancient order and age of the sacraments of initiation? What is the liturgy supposed to be like? Does Christ wish for all, even the tiniest children, to receive Him in communion?

[Nation of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam), despite its name, it not considered a Muslim group by any mainstream or even fringe Muslim groups. Nation of Islam is a black supremacist UFO cult...so you've got to be black to join, and you've got to be a racist. They're openly anti-semitic and anti-asian.

Scientology counts a number of famous people in its UFO cult: Tom Cruise, Giovanni Ribisi, John Travolta, Michael Pe√±a, and others. Moreover, the doctrines of Scientology have become the cornerstone of many other, seemingly unrelated cults.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/DebateReligion.jsonl,DebateReligion.jsonl,rzhphu,The Euthyphro Dilemma: Why the most common theist response does not resolve the dilemma.,"The Euthyphro Dilemma is of central importance to the debate about ethics. In essence, the dilemma asks: Are God‚Äôs commands good because they are given by God, or does God give them because they are good?  **Option A:** If God‚Äôs commands are good because they come from God, then senseless cruelty would become moral if God wills it to be so. This would make morality arbitrary. It would not be meaningful to say that God is good if anything can be good. This is obviously an unacceptable choice for theists.  **Option B:** If God gives commands because they are good, then God is following rules that he/she/it did not create and has no control over. If these moral precepts exist independent from God, then other beings can follow them independently of God. Secular morality based on these independent principles would be equally valid as morality founded on God‚Äôs goodness.  Since the dilemma is phrased in a ‚ÄòA‚Äô or ‚ÄòB‚Äô format, it‚Äôs possible to create an option ‚ÄòC‚Äô. The typical Christian response to this dilemma is to claim that there is a third path that solves the dilemma.   **Option C:** Goodness is an innate part of God‚Äôs character and all commands he gives are in accordance with this innate goodness.  To me, it looks like Christian apologists are trying to pull a fast one here. Option C pushes the dilemma back a level, but the problem is still unsolved. What determines God‚Äôs innate character? This time around, I will be careful to phrase the dilemma in the format ‚ÄòA‚Äô or ‚Äònot A‚Äô so there is no wiggle room to create new options.  Let's take a closer look at Option C to see why the dilemma remains unsolved.      Did God choose his own character traits or not?         Yes, God chose his own innate character traits              Did he base that choice on a reason or not?                    Yes, there was a reason.                          Conclusion: That reason is the ultimate moral standard, not God himself.                          Secular morality based on reason can be equally valid as morality based on God. 		           No, there wasn‚Äôt a reason.                          Conclusion: Morality is arbitrary and might as well be based on a coin flip.         No, God did not choose his own character traits.               Conclusion: God is subject to rules that he cannot change and has no control over.               If God has no control of his inherent nature, then he is merely fulfilling his programming, no different than a robot.               In this case, morality is arbitrary.  No being, regardless of how powerful or benevolent they are, can be the source of objective morality. Either their morality is based on reason, in which case a secular formulation of that reasoning is equally valid OR their morality is arbitrary and it is pure luck that torturing babies happens to be a bad thing.  My moral intuitions are my subjective opinion. The moral intuitions of a stronger, smarter, or nicer person would be just as subjective as my own. Superman, if he were real, would have moral intuitions that are just as subjective as any other being you could choose. I fail to see how the moral intuitions of a Supreme Being could somehow jump the gap between subjective and objective.

Absolutely no doubt in his mind that it's just not true. I didn't challenge him directly, but I pressed him for what he thought evolution was. He didn't know what it is or even what it explains. I got all kinds of crap out of him... Evolution is ""with the sun particles coming down and monkeys"" and it conflicts with ""God's creation of the heavens and the earth"" and other crap. Absolutely nothing about inheritance, selection, or variation. It was embarrassing really.  It took a twenty minute metro ride but I think I made him doubt his confidence by making him show both of us how little he knew about what evolution even was. I didn't explain what evolution was to him, I just told him ""that's not evolution, you shouldn't say you don't believe in it when you don't know what it is"" whenever he came up with some other crap. I'm hoping I made him curious enough to seek information himself but I doubt it.  I came home to my apartment and told my new roommate who is doing a masters in cellular biochemistry. I needed to confide in someone! My roommate then begins telling me how ""evolution is just a theory""...  God damn it! Surely someone is with me on this!","Hell, I'm a Christian and I'm with you on this. Denying evolution at this point speaks to either terrible ignorance or terrible intellectual dishonesty. It's frustrating to see, and it's frustrating to put up with.  I admire your patience in putting up with 20 minutes of it. Some might have just dropped the subject. Unfortunately, there's usually no way to force someone to discard there ignorance -- but who knows? Maybe you planted the seeds of something that may blossom if he sometime reaches the point where he can allow himself to ask those kinds of questions sincerely.  Your roommate, though....what the hell.",as a european i never really have to consider the madness of meeting someone who does not accept the proof of evolution. i really wish the schools in america would stop teaching children fairy tales in school in the guise of fact. i find it so very worrying that such a powerful military country is so full of people who think that the rain is the tears of angles and that there is a santa clause lookin guy who grants wishes if you are nice not naughty... it laughable... and the USA wonders why its the but of the worlds jokes,comment_2,"Closed to Diverse Perspectives,

Can you share the backstory a little? Is it based on your experiences?,"Thanks a bunch!    Until last summer, I had been a witch.  I was always reaching out to the goddesses, the spirit world; sitting in the garden, singing under the moon.  There was never an answer, nothing at all.  Even though I read tons on supernatural experiences, I had none and was honest with myself about that fact.  Over time I began to notice that people gave me funny looks when I spoke of the supernatural world.  Then I met other witches and supernatural minded people and was stunned; they were father from reality then I was, some were probably never going to come back.    When I discovered r/atheism, it changed everything, unexpectedly.  I realized that all of the beliefs of the supernatural folks could easily fit into Russell's Teapot; and I found that ALL of my beliefs had flown up into that teapot and I would not be able to retrieve them, without evidence.     Since then, there have been so many great changes in my life; more then just shelf space and more time, I think differently now and that affects everything.  I was going through my winter gardening plans and realized that I did not do a Persephone ritual this year, and you know?... everything went just fine, without it.  I am not looking for signs from the goddess in the gardenanymore; I am looking at the garden, thinking about how to make it produce more food.  No more waiting for invisible hands from imaginary goddesses, I put my own hands and my own mind to work.  It's liberating to be free of them; funny, because when I left the xian church, I found the goddesses empowering.  Baby steps to reality, I guess.

Oh he‚Äôs a good guy or I‚Äôm a good person I donate to charity and have never committed a crime. Then their is Hitler, a person we all use to describe as one of the worst people to ever live.   I started to think about that. What if I had lived in nazi Germany. How would that change my outlook. Would I be a nazi? I also wondered what it would be like to be in Hitler‚Äôs shoes. Would I be just as evil due to this new environment?  I also wondered about what makes us do things good or bad. I could only come up with two the DNA(the body and mind) we are born with and the environment into which we are born and live.   With only these two factors that guide every decision thought and action a person can make this leaves an implication. These two factors nature and nurture are both not a choice and lay outside of our control. Using Hitler one of the worst people in the world as an example, has made every decision and action only based on these two factors.  Therefore we as humans Hitler included do not have free will unless their is a deity. Hitler technically had no free will and choices are just an illusion.   Without a god we really are just atoms and molecules smashing into each other. So maybe maybe instead of judging criminals and wrong doers, we should realize they are people who were not as fortunate as us who might still need to be removed from society through the penal system but still are people.",Do you think god gives us free will or does it even exist?,"From a theoretical moral standpoint, the free will vs determinism does little for morality, even if one is a determinist.

I don't even know why monotheism should be an obvious choice over polytheism. If there's one thing I think/feel strongly, however, it is that the model of God that many Christians adopt (the all-good, all-powerful and all-knowing entity) doesn't seem at all convincing. I don't think this disproves Christianity per se (unless you say the three assumptions are absolutely critical to Christianity and disagreement on any one of them (ceteris paribus) results in a religion inherently un-Christian).  Basically I've been wrestling with the problem of evil. Particularly in respect to natural evils. And I would like arguments that can reconcile the Christian God with the reality that life, for a lot of people, has been and is chock full of suffering. This seems to me to be the only real contradiction within popular Christianity and the reason why I'm sure it isn't true. And not only is this suffering a times horrendous, but it's unevenly distributed. Some people's lives are the pits, and other's are paradises. Putting myself in the position of a suffering individual, I find it hard to see any justification for this that allows for an omni-benevolent deity. Personally I favour cutting out the omni-benevolent attribute. Not to say God is malicious, but he certainly isn't as good as he could be.  You could also point me to resources. That would be nice too.","Generally, it is us humans that cause our own suffering. Sure, natural disasters happen, but the greatest pain is a gift from ourselves. God gave us this beautiful planet to rule over, and we're doing a damn fine job of mucking it up. Stop laying our maliciousness at his feet.   God could have created people without the capacity for evil, I think. But this would negate any semblance of human will, we'd be robots incapable of real choice, and thereby incapable of spiritual growth.   Even the greatest suffering in this life is temporary, and extremely short in the grand scheme of eternity. Should God stop the world on account of some temporary suffering, denying the opportunity of life to the billions or trillions who would come after?","This is like one of the most basic objection that any apologist (people defending the faith) face the most often. It's also not so much the  I can take a different route with you though.

I find it much easier to get angry with God and others and myself than angry with demons. I know that is backwards, you don't have to tell me that, I am here trying to sort it out not to encourage or defend it. But if I'm being honest, for reasons that I don't think I fully understand, part of me finds demons to be sort of sympathetic and cool and edgy and mysterious and interesting, and even actually likes how destructive and rebellious they are. God seems cool too to me most of the time these days, oddly enough, but I don't love Him the way I need to and can get mad at Him far too easily. He's not relatable, I think that's part of the difference. I can relate to wanting to rebel against authority and even to being very very angry and destructive. I can't really relate to things like being holy or perfect or being goodness itself or anything like this, and if I'm being honest I'm not even 100% sure I fully grasp these concepts.  There is a theological piece here too: when it comes to all the suffering and difficulty of life, it is hard for me to see the buck stopping at demons/satan when they did not create the world, but are themselves created beings. It seems like the buck for it all has to stop with the creator.  We can get into theological discussions around this last bit but just as if not more helpful I think would be practical advise and hearing from people who feel or have felt a similar way (and ideally have worked through it). Are there any specific prayers or techniques for encouraging demon-hate?  I experience a lot of anger issues and it would be great to be able to direct some/all of that anger towards a reasonable target (satan, demons, sin) rather than it's usual dysfunctional expressions (breaking stuff, getting mad at God, at others, beating up on myself internally).","They are causing all of the sickness and suffering in the world.

Recently when speaking to a few friends I have heard this comment ""You know you're referring to this God thing a lot and you know you're scaring people.""  Really? Can you scare people with your own beliefs? I guess if your beliefs are different or maybe if you have none of your own.  I get it, I grew up Catholic, my Priest was a drunk and a hypocrite that wouldn't let me have my communion. That was until my dad paid him off. So yes, ""religion"" left a bad taste in my mouth.  I realize everyone has their own closeness to ""God"" and what they believe. I never try to push my ""God"" on anyone, I only speak of what he has done in my life and how my beliefs got me through my darkest hours. You might have your own way to get through things or your own person or thing that you believe in and if that works for you, terrific! Whatever gets you through your day, if it works for you, it works for me.  But again this is my journey, this is who saved me when lying in my dealer's house after an eight day coke binge. Passed out on the floor in the same dirty clothes, wacked out of my mind. I was at one of the lowest points in my life, it was then that I fell to my knees and cried out for help because I no longer had the strength to go on. It was God who gave me the strength to pick myself up and walk out that door and leave all the drugs and drinking behind.  It was God who stopped me from killing myself when I couldn't go on one more day with a man who treated his dog better than he treated me. It was God who gave me the courage and strength to leave, to start my own business, to know that I didn't need a man, any man to do this.  Look, your ""God"" might be Buddha, Hosana, or anything else you want to call him, or nothing at all. Maybe you're just spiritual, it doesn't matter, does it get you through your darkest times? Does it give you comfort? Does it calm your fears? Then it works for you.  I don't preach ""If you don't do this, or that, you will go to hell""  ""If you are this type of person, your going to hell"" ""If your not perfect, your going to hell""  ""If you don't believe what I believe, you're going to hell""  No, I am far.... far from perfect. My Bishop says we come to church because we are all sick and need to be healed. That was surely me. There are no perfect people, I am just trying to be the best I can be and sharing my journey in hopes that you might be reading this. Maybe you don't think you can go on, or that no one understands you or you feel alone and scared.   I want these people to know that you are not alone. I've been there, I was scared, I also laid on the floor crying and begging for help. The only difference between me and you is I put my stuff out there for the world to see to try to help another person. This is why I write this blog everyday, this is my purpose.  I am saying that for me, God has worked and in telling my story, I must tell you how I got to the place I am now, for me it was God. You might want to take another road and I am fine with that, but this is my journey and I write about what I know and what works for me.  I just want to be a blessing to others and to inspire others. If my beliefs scare you, read the next day's blog, believe me it will be different as I write about what moves me each day, whatever that may be.  But I must tell you, I will be talking about God every Monday as he is the one who saved my life and who each and every day I give thanks to and will continue to praise.   So today my friends, I hope that this clears up the issue of my faith and my ""preaching"" about it.

I'm perfectly aware that this might be an unusual topic, or, even worse, be dismissed as a joke. But I'm terribly upset about being neonatally circumcised as an infant. (I was born in the United States) I know that a majority of you will probably respond that circumcision isn't a big deal since it is in the Bible. But what you probably don't know is that the modern procedure form in the United States is vastly more destructive.  The original Brit Milah (e.g. Biblical circumcision) partially cut off a portion of the ridged band - whatever hung over the glans penis - but kept some of the sexually sensitive ridged band, along with almost all of the foreskin and frenulum: a feature not carried on into the modern day.  [Sometime between 120-150 AD (far after Christ) the procedure was radicalized into a form similar to today's called Brit Periah: the ""shredding of the glans.""](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4391-circumcision ) This was not the Abrahamic covenant of Genesis 17. So I don't consider this a violation of 1 Corinthians 7:19. This version always completely destroys the entire ridged band, the entire frenulum, and any part of the foreskin that covers any part of the glans penis. This version of circumcision eventually became the dominant form practiced throughout the world.  I'm horrified to know that large amounts of sexually sensitive tissue were removed from my genitals as a baby. And it's been incredibly destructive to my faith to know that a misinterpretations of the Bible was one of the motivations for my parents circumcising me, figuring, incorrectly, that it was done for health and medical benefits in the Old Testament.  There is an organization called /r/Foregen researching on how the damage of neonatal circumcision can be partially reversed in the short to medium future. (5-20 years)  A few of the scientists on the board are devout Catholics. (They are based in Italy) So it isn't like it's some anti-religious/Atheist thing. Groups such as Wake Forest medical institute are also looking into it. And I've been praying like crazy that one of these groups succeeds in their goals. I realize it'll be a miracle: one that I really, really want to beg to God for.  This issue drives me nuts. I'm diagnosed with Aspergers. So empathic feelings, feelings of violation, etc. are particularly strong for me. So please, please pray that some form of circumcision reversal surgery will be possible within the next twenty or twenty-five years. (As soon as God's will permits it)   I'm not a hedonist. But knowing something holy, something good, something related to how humans physically express their love has been taken from me, for no good reason at all, has spiralled me into a horrid depression. And I want to know what it's like when I get married. I want my whole body back.  This issue has killed my self-confidence like no other. I have significant trouble looking at my body, and particularly my genitals, without an immense level of disgust and emotional turnoil. I feel violated on a deeply personal level.   I literally keep bawling my eyes out.   How I realized this as a minor miracle itself. Unlike the vast majority of men who were circumcised with a gomco clamp: my entire frenulum was basically left intact. (I'm basically partially circumcised...)  And I always wondered (even as a little boy) why a very sensitive ""connector"" of tissue  was on the back of my genitals. It seemed even then that something ""else"" (e.g. ridged band/foreskin) was supposed to cover it.  A couple of months ago I decided to investigate what it was. I saw that they cut me right where the frenulum ends.   ""Oh, it's a frenulum.""   Which puzzled me greatly. So I assumed that it was like that on every guy who was circumcised. That they just ""cut it off"" where it ends.  Right? They weren't *cutting this off children* in *hospitals* were they? I started to research.   And through some reading and some a few NSFW pictures: (I honestly didn't know where to look... and I'm heterosexual... so I just hoped on to Reddit's porn pages - literally for research - and checked.)   And I quickly realized that wasn't true. And what I learned horrified me.   The sexually sensitive frenulum is apart of a singular structure called the frenular delta. It consists of the ridged bands at the tip of the foreskin, the frenulum, and a mucocutaneous junction where they connect.  For intact men: this structure is the most pleasurable and sensual part of their penis. It's entirely destroyed in the vast majority of American neonatal circumcisions.   I kept digging. I found a 2007 study by a doctor named Morris Sorrells that plotted the most pleasurable parts of the male body... and it completely matched my own. (Look up ""Sorrells 2007 study circumcision graphic"" for a NSFW graphic) Half of the purple on that chart (the inner foreskin...the part on circumcised men that is after the scar) was deleted, the ridged bands were basically destroyed, the frenulum was extremely sensitive, and the circumcision scar was the next most sensitive spot.  I started hysterically crying. And I got extremely angry.  By coincidence... it appears that I'm not the only one who has noticed this fact. The pathologist who named this structure, Australian pathologist Ken McGrath, strongly opposes American neonatal circumcision. He even [made a video on how neonatal circumcision is a uniquely destructive medical intervention vs. those later in life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vD-L-T5n8g)  It startled me. It still does. And it made me cry: a lot. Not just for myself...but for a majority of American men.  I'm shocked this isn't a national controversy: considering how sex-obsessed American culture is. The fact that it's impossible to feel anything on removed tissue is common sense. Yet it seems like there is a massive cognitive blindness on this issue here.  I feel sexually hurt on such a deeply, utterly, personal level. On the most private, personal, and deeply part of my body. And it's caused me to become misanthropic, depressed, and terribly anxious. I feel utterly abandoned by God and so alone.  It feels like I have no spiritual, emotional, psychological, or mental support on this issue. And I'm just forced to live with a sexual violation on my body until some solution can be found. And most people aren't even aware that there is a problem in the future place.  It's a very difficult feeling to live with. Since you feel so violated, without emotional or spiritual support, and so terribly alone in your thoughts. It's a weird cultural and pseudo-medical tradition in the United States, particularly among evangelical Protestants and Catholics here. so I'm afraid if I'm mentioned this to someone publicly (even a priest/pastor) I'd be laughed off as absolutely nuts. (""e.g. Shut up, hedonist... Shut up, you can cum... Shut up, X got circumcised as an adult for an extremely rare medical issue... Shut up, it's in the Bible..."")  And I don't really have anyone to blame for this in particular. I know that my parents didn't do this out of malice, or hatred, or zealotry, or some sick desire to ruin my future love life with my wife. It just seems to be a ""American"" practice that has essentially wormed its way into what ""Christians"" are supposed to do in the United States.  It just makes me feel sexually, physically, and spiritually (in terms of being loved by God) inferior to those who were left alone. The vast majority of them openly defy biblical teachings on sexuality. I wanted to wait until marriage. Yet it seems that they'll experiencing things I may never will. Like God allowed them to be rewarded. While being totally indifferent to my pain, troubles, and suffering.  I'm aware that many people, both men and women, including saints, have undergone much worse forms of harm and suffering, including sexual, in their life.   Truly: mine doesn't nearly compare in many ways.  But the fact that this was done by doctors, who are supposed to heal you; by my Christian parents who are supposed to, guided by God, protect and love me; and partially justified by a misinterpretation of the Bible makes it so much emotionally and spiritually difficult to deal with.   A ticking time bomb for my faith.  And I'm absolutely clueless on how to proceed. Why didn't God warn my parents? Isn't God supposed to lead Christians to correct spiritual knowledge? Why isn't the Bible more clear on this issue? Why did it not specify which form of cutting is permitted? There has to be a reason why this happened to me? Right? Why were other people left alone?  I don't know. I feel utterly abandoned. And even worse: there's very few individuals IRL who know anything about this issue. Or could even help me process it. If not a cure or a way to reverse it... at least an answer and comfort.  Once I realized what happened to me: I've felt very sad and frustrated that - as of 2020 - I didn't get to keep the genitals that God gave me. I know that circumcised men still enjoy sex. (Although, if done neonatally, they generally feel less from it) But above all: I just want to feel whole, complete, and undamaged. Because every ounce of my being makes this feel so wrong.  I'm sorry if this seems like a joke. I know that most people in the United States/even in church aren't really informed about any of this. (Difference between neonatal v. adult circumcision, biblical v. modern circumcision, the actual benefits v. risks, etc.) I just need spiritual help, comfort, and, hopefully, in the future, a reversal to the damage, God permitting. And this isn't something you can necessarily talk about in public without being seen as a quack.  Please tell me I haven't gone completely crazy.  Is it possible here for people to pray that:  1.) That God comforts me (At the very least)  2.) That I could be healed from this injury in the future. (Whether through modern advancements in regenerative therapies/miracle)  3.) That this doesn't happen to more children. (Most importantly)   Thanks. I don't want anyone else to go through the emotional pain I have. I'd ask for you to pray that Wake Forest/Foregen works: but, if not, may you also request (provided the former doesn't happen) that God comforts me and lets me accept it?","Hiüëã  Don't worry, God has answered your prayers.","I prayed for you, foregen and wake forest.

Or Christ. Or that Joseph Smith restored the true gospel.  I appreciate the recent testimony posts for what they provide--the opportunity for introspection and good conversation. I did, however, feel hurt at the repeated insinuation that the reason I don't share these views is because I haven't been sincere in my search for truth.   For those who are in the same boat I find myself in relation to these posts, I‚Äôd like to share my experience with God.  (Wall of text warning--TLDR at the end!)   I am Mormon. I always had a yearning to know and understand the complexities of the gospel, and always tried to be the best daughter of God that I could be. Despite that, I never had what I would call a personal relationship to him. I prayed, but never felt the spirit. It never really bothered me, though.  That is, until my freshman year of college. By October, something had awoken from the back of my mind and lurked. I refused to give it a  name, and instead worked hard at throwing myself into everything college had to offer, including single's ward.  By the end of February, the gig was up. Despite my best efforts to combat the evil inside me, I was forced to recognize that my feelings for my best friend went beyond friendship. I couldn't call it homosexuality or even same-sex attraction. I went around in circles in my journal trying to quantify it in a way that made it okay, that made it anything BUT romantic attraction to another woman. I prayed, often, needing some sort of reassurance.  I became increasingly depressed, and withdrawn from my friends. By April, I was daily reading the scriptures and praying for hours to God. I asked for mercy. I asked for comfort. I asked for the strength to carry this burden, because I didn't think I could do it alone. I told God I would sacrifice everything for him, I would live the church teachings of my burden, but I desperately needed his support. I painstakingly recorded this soul-searching in my journal.  I fasted often. And then, after that didn't work, I grew so depressed that I couldn't eat, anyway.  From God's silence, I finally grew outright suicidal. I didn't want to be alive and I didn't want to deal with this pain anymore. I told God that either he would come to me, or I would go to him, but I absolutely could not continue on the way things were.  He never came.   Five years later, I am here through a lot of hard work and therapy. I was forced to abandon the church because their promises of God only kept me in a cycle of depression and suicide. I'm happier now than I've ever been. By their fruits ye shall know them.  I appreciate that some people have had powerful experiences within the church, but I think it is naive and even a little bit condescending to assume that these experiences are available to everyone. I tried. I truly did, with a sincere and humble heart. I was a confused 18 year-old who was not able to handle the grown-up reality of life, and to dismiss my experience and call me back to the fold with an offer to try harder is dismissive of the very real experiences that I have  had.  TLDR: Realized I was gay, grew depressed and suicidal because no matter how hard I prayed for help, God was never there.",I'm sorry that you had such a difficult experience. Hopefully wherever you are now you are happier and at peace.,"Thank you for sharing that, I imagine it's still not easy.  I abhor the insinuation that anyone who believes differently, for any reason, simply wasn't trying hard enough (or worse, chose to ignore the truth for hedonistic reasons).

I also know some people really disagree with his focus on sitting meditation.  What are some good things? (From people who dig his style.)  What's up of the bad/ugly things?  There's a section on Wikipedia titled ""Miraculous events and auspicious signs"" that's pretty ""shifty"" but it seems like things lumped onto him posthumously.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like Dogen was a serious and diligent student of Zen (whether you agree or disagree with his preferred method of practice).  Are there ""questionable"" things about Dogen or did a questionable religion/practice use him as its foundation and grow from there?  Feel free to post the various subreddit wiki links I've seen before, I'll inspect them more closely. I'm looking for other opinions or resources to shed more light on the dude if anyone feels like sharing. Other than Wikipedia I read through this bit about Dogen:  https://dharmanet.org/coursesM/27/zenstory27.htm  For some context as to why I'm asking, a friend gave me the ""Zen Sourcebook"" and it has some stuff by Dogen in it along with the ""usual cast of characters"" (Huangbo, etc.)  https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Sourcebook-Traditional-Documents-China/dp/0872209091","If you want to follow Dogen's practices, then follow Dogen's practices, but don't proselytize under a thin veneer of feigned interest in our answers.  I really don't understand the point of looking towards Dogen when the Chan patriarchs and their gifted circle got it entirely right to begin with.","&gt;a friend gave me the ""Zen Sourcebook""  lots of people including academics have tried to piece together ""zen sources"".      in the long run,  there will probably be a text that helps clarify misconceptions about ""zen sources""  in the meantime,   the period of the six patriarchs is key,  and then the period including and following Mazu and Dongshan,  which is richly covered in the primary zen texts,  the real zen sources,  which are the stories,  cases,  and conversations of the central zen characters in Mazu's and Dongshan's family.  Its up to each of us who claim to be interested in zen to get familiar with the characters in this family,  including Layman Pang,   Joshu,  Deshan,  Yunmen,  and a few dozen others that recognized each other and also pointed out how to tell the frauds.  And there were plenty of frauds too,  plenty of marginal characters who at worst misrepresented zen,  and at best are so secondary that they are a waste of time for anyone still trying to hear what the core zen characters had to say,  or pointed towards.  My advice:   Skip Dogen if you don't want to grapple with a mess of confusing misdirection.    Also,  the only reasons anyone would feel they had to take on Dogen would be if they had assigned some loyalty to or importance to one of the priestly buddhist lines of Japan.   Oh,  there is another reason too:   real students of zen eventually tire of the fraudulent claims of buddhist adherents of Dogen who think they have the right and duty to take over the r/zen subreddit,  including becoming the head moderator,  and show such poor judgement and poor self control that they are an embarrassment to their own buddhist claims:  some zen students would look into Dogen enough to debunk him and his promoters.",comment_1,"Displays Absolutist Language,

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/OrthodoxChristianity.jsonl,OrthodoxChristianity.jsonl,1tmge1,Questions from a Protestant,"Hello all! I've been a Protestant all my life, and I have become interested in the Orthodox Church.  If it's all right with you, I have some questions about your beliefs.  ‚Ä¢What are your views on the Law and Commandments? ‚Ä¢What are your views on the state of the dead? ‚Ä¢Do you pray to saints? ‚Ä¢What do you believe concerning the Virgin Mary? ‚Ä¢Who/what is the patriarch?  Is it the same as the old church's tetrarchy? ‚Ä¢What's the difference between Eastern Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Coptic, etc. ‚Ä¢What is an icon? ‚Ä¢Is pascha the same as Easter? ‚Ä¢Why is everything in Greek?  Thanks for your time.  God bless.  EDIT:  questions I've come up with after the OP:  ‚Ä¢What is a Catechumen? ‚Ä¢What are your views on the pope?","Each one of your questions could be covered by an entire chapter in a book, and still not even begin to completely answer the question, so any answers you get here in one or two sentences are not going to be adequate, but hopefully they will wet your appetite to learn more.   Good for you for being interested in religious things, faith is a rare commodity these days.   I'm a catehcumen (Orthodox, but not baptized yet) so my answers will undoubtedly contain some odd and not quite Orthodox concepts, but hopefully someone will correct me if I'm dead wrong about anything.  &gt;What are your views on the Law and Commandments?  Do you mean the Hebrew Old Testament in general? It's great, but it seems to me that in general it is misunderstood by a lot of Christians and misapplied.   &gt;What are your views on the state of the dead?  I think different people in Orthodoxy have different views, my personal view is that during the funeral service we say ""Memory Eternal"", but in the Bible when it talks about people dying it says they go to sleep (little girl, Lazarus, St Stephen), when we put these together it means that when a person dies their body goes to sleep, but their spirit continues to exist in God's memory for eternity.   Eventually Jesus said there will be a resurrection, in which God will raise up the body, and reunite it with the spirit of that person which exists in his memory.   There are also some who God deems worthy to enter heaven early, before the resurrection, and these ones are called Saints.   &gt;Do you pray to saints?  Pray just means ask, in old style English it's perfectly acceptable for me to say to you ""I pray thee give me a glass of water"", so in that sense, we do ask Saints for help.   If you were in heaven, and you saw your family, or even just mankind in general suffering down here on earth, wouldnt you want to help them?   We believe the Saints do want to help us, that they are in the heavenly congregation and we are in the earthly congregation, but it is all just one congregation, serving God at the same time.   &gt;What do you believe concerning the Virgin Mary?  That Jesus, somehow, really was God made flesh, and that God really did live in her womb for nine months, and that she gave birth to God upon earth, and then breast fed God, changed his diapers, and then taught him to speak, and to walk, and all the things which a mother does to the son that she loves.   This gives Marry a very special position, and we believe that she is one of the Saints, now in heaven, sitting at the feet of her son, so to speak, and that she loves us and wants to help us to worship her son, who is God.   &gt;Who/what is the patriarch?   A bishop.   &gt;Is it the same as the old church's tetrarchy?  I dont know.   &gt;What's the difference between Eastern Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Coptic, etc.  Language, location, culture, and history. But not doctrine, mostly, although there are a few little arguments over small matters it's nothing to worry about.   &gt;What is an icon  A visual representation of something holy, they can be viewed as a window into the past, the present, or even the future. A window into heaven itself.   We do not worship icons, we do not think that icons are our Gods, we know they are only representations, but because we love what it is that they represent, we show that love to the icon itself, by praying before it, or even by kissing it.   Just as you might pray for someone you love while holding a picture of that person, and you might even kiss a picture of someone that you love. If someone called you an idolater for doing that, you would rightly be offended.  &gt;Is pascha the same as Easter  Yes.   &gt;Why is everything in Greek  It depends where you go, if you go to a Greek Church you will hear a lot of Greek, if you go to a Russian Church you will hear a lot of Russian.   But there are also a lot of churches that are doing their services completely in English, I go to one of them.   &gt;What is a Catechumen?  A person who is dedicated to God, who wants to become Orthodox, and is even considered part of the Orthodox family, and who is preparing themselves for baptism.   &gt;What are your views on the pope.  Orthodoxy has the traditional view, that there are five branches, or patriarchates, of the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Orthodox Church.    The five patriarchates are Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Egypt. (iirc) And each patriarchate has a Bishop over it.   We believe that the Pope is the Bishop of the patriarchate of Rome, we have always recognized him as that Bishop, and always will recognize him as that Bishop, but we believe that he has broken communion with the rest of the patriarchies.   But although he has broken communion, we do not believe that somehow he is not the Bishop of Rome, he is Romes Bishop, we've never tried to replace him, and we never would.   edit: Wow, thank you for the gold!","Really outstanding - a lot of good, basic info there for the OP.  If the Orthodox (and I'm on of them!) can be said to have a sort of group bad habit, it lies in our tendency to trot out 17 citations from the early Church Fathers for every little question that comes up. Yes, that foundation is our strength -- but it's also pretty hard for those outside of Orthodoxy to get their arms around.  Bonus clarification for the OP: In case it wasn't clear, we don't agree with papal infallibility and don't ascribe infallibility to our own leaders.",comment_2,Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,"Recognizes limitations in one‚Äôs own knowledge or beliefs,

My parents put the hijab on me when i was about 5-6 years old. It wasn't really forced. I saw it as an obligation by Allah that i had to carry out. During that time i really loved my religion and felt pride in representing it. I actually wore it at all times, like i deadass used to sleep in it from 6-15. I've worn the hijab for 13 years since then.   My hair was super damaged mainly because i neglected it. I held off from taking the hijab off because of my deep insecurity of my hair and also because of the family issues that would arise and fear of backlash. I have curly wavy hair and after healing and styling it. i felt ready to take off my hijab and embrace my naked head. it was difficult to convince my parents but after some time they just accepted it.  It was scary and nerve wrecking taking it off, also a bit exciting. when i first went outside without it, I remember my head feeling naked and not being used to that. And when i felt the breeze run through my neck and tickle the back of my ears I felt so alive and happy. It's literally such a small thing to be happy about but it's so big to me.  The first day of school i wore a bandanna with only my bangs out because i wanted to take baby steps before fully taking it off. And the second day I let my hair down and before i even walked inside, this guy complimented my hair. And it felt so good to have my hair acknowledged but also as someone who is insecure about my hair it was so nice and uplifting. For the first time I actually feel comfortable in my body. I can look in the mirror and actually feel like myself. It's just so refreshing to finally let my hair breath. i just never thought I'd see the day happen.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_active/Buddhism.jsonl,Buddhism.jsonl,wzoleu,Did Buddha ‚Äúlie‚Äù to Arahants for 40 years according to Lotus Sutra?,"I‚Äôd like to ask some questions regarding the Lotus Sutra, but I‚Äôm not sure if I am asking the right questions or even having the right view on it, but please do direct me to the right understanding if I am deviating from it.   According to the Lotus Sutra, it contains the final teaching of Gautama Buddha, and he says that for 40 years he didn‚Äôt teach the truth, but that he will teach it now, when it‚Äôs around the corner of his parinirvana? I am wondering why he waited for 40 years? (Please pardon me if I got the years wrong).   Is it correct for me to get the impression that he ‚Äúlied‚Äù to arahants for 40 years, teaching them to attain nirvana?  Is it skillful to interpret that Buddha had instead trick them into a reality that they just became bodhisattvas that will keep rebirthing until they finally do make it to the real nirvana?  Isn‚Äôt lying and tricking fundamentally opposed to the teaching of Buddha dharma?   How about all the arahants who had died/attained parinirvana during those 40 years before Lotus Sutra was taught? I am wondering how would they know the true truth now?   How about the Arahant Rahula and Arahant Bhaddakaccana (Yashodara) who passed away way earlier before Buddha possibly taught Lotus Sutra? Would it be fair to let his son and wife (during his bodhisattva life) pass away into a false reality without teaching them the true reality of their awakening according to Lotus Sutra?   Please pardon me if I got any of the interpretations wrong. I‚Äôd just like to understand about this more.   Thank you in advance‚Ä¶",Did you even read it?  The sutra emphasizes that this is not a lie.,"Did the Buddha lie to Nanda when he promised him all the beautiful goddesses of a certain heaven to ""trick"" him into ordaining and practicing seriously? This is in the PƒÅli Canon.   &gt; Is it correct for me to get the impression that he ‚Äúlied‚Äù to arahants for 40 years, teaching them to attain nirvana?  The position of the Lotus Sutra is that there is only one finality in the Dharma: buddhahood. There's no final nirvana aside from that which comes with buddhahood. All vehicles (in the context of this sutra, the three vehicles of ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna, PratyekabuddhayƒÅna and BodhisattvayƒÅna are all provisional. In reality, there is only the singular EkayƒÅna, the vehicle leading to buddhahood. The three yƒÅnas then become more or less roundabout ways of eventually arriving there, according to the dispositions of beings.  The simile of the burning house and the promise of the three carts that gets superseded by one cart is the same in nature as the ""trick"" played on Nanda. He practiced because he really wanted to get a harem of unearthly beauties, but as the practice took hold of him, this desire went away and he realized that he obtained something infinitely better. Likewise, the father promised the carts that each child was fond of to get them out of the house, and when they did, they found a different cart that was infinitely better than what they originally  wanted. The revelation of the EkayƒÅna is to be understood along these lines, if you read that simile and think about it I think it'll become clear.  This aspect of the MahƒÅyƒÅna is a known difficulty for TheravƒÅdins and people who generally have a very narrow definition of truthfulness. In reality, similar ""tricks"" or skillful means are used by the Buddha in the ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna texts as well. Maybe appreciating this requires thinking a bit more carefully about whether the Buddha's idea of deception amounted to a simplistic notion of not making a factually true statement, or if it has more to do with the fact that when people deceive, it's practically always out of a selfish concern, or for harming someone else.  &gt; How about all the arahants who had died/attained parinirvana during those 40 years before Lotus Sutra was taught? I am wondering how would they know the true truth now?   Again the sutra says that arhats who haven't entered the MahƒÅyƒÅna (i.e. EkayƒÅna) are free from rebirth and enter a state of extinction, but are then eventually ""woken up"" by a buddha, and directed towards the MahƒÅyƒÅna. This is often misunderstood as saying that arhats have merely been reborn on some ineffable place, but that's not correct. The MahƒÅyƒÅna doesn't deny that what the Buddha teaches about nirvana in the ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna texts is true. This is a separate discussion, but it rests on reality being perceived through emptiness, as in that context the idea of some otherworldly annihilation makes no sense (not that TheravƒÅdins universally hold that an annihilation that is not called annihilation is what nirvana is, anyway).  In addition, it's incorrect to assume that all arhats necessarily had not entered the MahƒÅyƒÅna before this teaching was put to words. ≈öƒÅriputra etc. are depicted as having already done that, unbeknownst to themselves, in a way.   &gt; How about the Arahant Rahula and Arahant Bhaddakaccana (Yashodara) who passed away way earlier before Buddha possibly taught Lotus Sutra?  Ya≈õodharƒÅ and RahulƒÅ both appear in the sutra and receive predictions of buddhahood. We don't factually know that they died before the Buddha.  &gt; Would it be fair to let his son and wife (during his bodhisattva life) pass away into a false reality without teaching them the true reality of their awakening according to Lotus Sutra?  The fact that the mother and son are alive and well in the Lotus Sutra aside, it has to be understood that many MahƒÅyƒÅna sutras proclaim to be the final/best/etc. teaching. There's no reason to take these at face value just like that. In addition, it's possible that some people had certain very deep MahƒÅyƒÅnic realizations that weren't necessarily explained in the words of MahƒÅyƒÅna theory, and about which they kept silent. IIRC the Avatamsaka Sutra has some interesting things to say about Ya≈õodharƒÅ''s attainments, for example. MahƒÅka≈õyapa is a famous example for getting the ultimate point of ""Zen teaching"" without the Buddha uttering a single word, and himself not giving any voiced explanation either.",comment_1,Condescending Attitude,Condescending Attitude,,,,,No,0.8266014789

Visiting a temple is definitely something I am planning to do soon.  When I visit the temple, how open should I be about my troubles? Are they just irrelevant and should I just listen?  I struggle with substance addiction. I've stopped using but this is the desire that causes me suffering the most, I constantly relapse and this has to do a lot with desire and suffering. I'm not trying to cure addiction with Buddhism, but I still feel like it's something important to me that I should be honest about. But the more I read about Buddhism, I feel like anything that start with ""I X...."" is irrelevant to the path of liberation.","It is fine to state your current troubles under the headline of ""this is how my life is right now, and explains some of my motivation for being here."" Lots of people with these issues turn to Buddhism for help. It sometimes does indeed help.","Hi there -   What you're doing is so hard and amazing at the same time - congrats on getting clean and wanting to stay there. I'm glad you're not seeing Buddhism as a cure all, but it's definitely helpful if you work at it. You may want to look into Refuge Recovery - it's a mindfulness based approach to recovery that may help you out.  How open you should be about your problems depends on what's going on at the temple - I'd start out by just listening and seeing what it's like. It also couldn't hurt to email whichever temple you decide to visit and see what they say.",comment_2,Mindful of others‚Äô feelings,Mindful of others‚Äô feelings,,,,,No,0.9539129761

Seek experience today so that it may lead you to greater and greater experience. It is better for you to ask questions of Spirit and then receive the experience that Spirit can give you. You are accustomed to receiving so little in response to your inquiries. An answer is so very little. A true answer must be an invitation to participate in a greater preparation, in a preparation you have not prepared for yourself but which has been prepared for you. Therefore, seek not for little things that give you momentary relief or comfort. Seek for that which is the foundation of your life, which can provide life to you as never before.  Today, in your two deeper practices, become receptive to this experience. You may use the word RAHN if you find it helpful, but enter deeply into the experience of Spirit. Do not seek for answers. Ideas will come to you in their own time and in their own way. You can be assured of that. As your mind is prepared, it will become truly receptive and truly capable of carrying out what it receives. This is the acknowledgement that you need. It must be born of great experience.  Upon the hour remind yourself of your practice, and realize it is genuine experience that you are seeking and not answers alone. Your mind is full of answers, and they have not answered your questioning thus far.","Not Zen.  What Master ever taught ""deeper practices""?  What Master ever taught ""great experience""?  This is the school of chop wood, carry water, here.  This is the school of ordinary mind.  Whatever ""comes to you"" is just thought creation, not Zen.","And besides,  if something were experienced,  just who or what would have been actually experiencing?   Me?  What me?  And out of what motive?   To get a leg up on the world?   To self improve?   To gain or to avoid?     Seeing.   It happens or not.   There is no preparation,  no trick.   No me that does it.  Look.

And when it was day, he called his disciples to him; and from them he chose twelve whom he also named apostles. Luke 6:13  So Yeshua said to them, ‚ÄúAssuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son  of Man sits on the throne of his glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.‚Äù Matthew 19:28  Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.  Revelation 21:14  #2. Paul was UNQUALIFIED to be an apostle. He could not take Judas‚Äô place.  So Yeshua said to them, ‚ÄúAssuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son  of Man sits on the throne of his glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve  thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.‚Äù Matthew 19:28  ‚ÄúTherefore, of THESE MEN WHO HAVE ACCOMPANIED US ALL THE TIME that the  Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John to  that day when he was taken up from us, ONE of THESE MUST become a witness  with us of his resurrection.‚Äù Acts 1:21,22  Peter clearly indicated there were a number of others who were qualified to be an apostle  because they had been there, but there was only one vacancy that needed filling. Paul didn‚Äôt  even qualify because he hadn‚Äôt been there.   Neither Jesus nor any of the original 12 apostles EVER referred to Paul as an apostle! Paul referred to himself as an apostle 20 times.  #3. Paul said Yeshua abolished the Law of Moses, but Yeshua said do not think he came to do any such thing!  ‚ÄúFor he himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle  wall of division between us, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, that is the law  of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in himself one new man  from the two thus making peace,‚Äù Ephesians 2:14,15  ‚ÄúTherefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of  Christ.‚Äù Romans 7:4  ‚ÄúFor Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.‚Äù Romans 10:4  ‚ÄúTherefore, the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by  faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.‚Äù Galatians 3:24  But Jesus said: ‚ÄúDO NOT think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I did NOT come to  destroy, but to fulfill‚Äù (‚Äúfulfill‚Äù Strong‚Äôs 4137: Thayer‚Äôs: To ratify, to execute fully.). ‚ÄúFor  assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by  no means pass from the law till all* is fulfilled‚Äù. (‚Äúfulfilled‚Äù= Strong‚Äôs 1096: Thayer‚Äôs:  completed, done). Matthew 5:17,18   # 4. Paul made a claim concerning Abraham that was simply not true.  ‚ÄúAnd not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead  (since he was about a hundred years old). And the deadness of Sarah‚Äôs womb. He  did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith,  giving glory to God.‚Äù Romans 4:19, 20  # 5. Paul believed his testimony should be considered as reliable as the testimony of three separate witnesses if he gave his testimony on three separate occasions!  ‚ÄúThis will be the third time I am coming to you. ‚ÄòBy the mouth of two or three  witnesses every word shall be established.‚Äô I have told you before, and foretell as if I  were present the second time, and now being absent I write‚Ä¶‚Äù 2 Corinthians 13:1,2  Jesus: ‚ÄúMoreover, if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and  him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he will not hear you,  take with you one or two more, that ‚Äòby the mouth of two or three witnesses every  word may be established.‚Äô‚Äù Matthew 18:15,16 (Deuteronomy 19:15)",Why are we following Paul instead of Jesus. Why are we not keeping the law if we are to follow Jesus. I am losing my faith.,"Here is a conversation that a disciple had with God about his own doubts about Paul:  &gt;13 ‚ÄúLord,‚Äù Ananias answered, ‚ÄúI have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. 14 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;15 But the Lord said to Ananias, ‚ÄúGo! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.  That's a pretty strong stamp of approval.   As to the others, I think you're blowing things way out of proportion and making assumptions that simply aren't warranted in the text.   Yes there were 12 apostles. But why assume a person couldn't be given the office of Apostle, but not the calling of the 12? Barnabas is referred to as an ‚Äúapostle‚Äù in Acts 13:2 and 14:4. Andronicus and Junias are possibly identified as apostles in Romans 16:7. The same Greek word usually translated ‚Äúapostle‚Äù is used to refer to Titus in 2 Corinthians 8:23 and Epaphroditus in Philippians 2:25. So, there definitely seems to be room for the term apostle being used to refer to someone besides the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ.  When it comes to individual teachings, Peter had this to say about what Paul wrote:  &gt;15 Bear in mind that our Lord‚Äôs patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. 16 He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.  That's Peter, the book of Acts, and Paul who all establish Paul's role as called messenger from God.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.09409209572

Is this a valid way to look at things? Why or why not?   Spiritual and Material Values  ""Every experience has its level of physiology, and so unbounded awareness has its own level of physiology which can be measured. Every aspect of life is integrated and connected with every other phase. When we talk of scientific measurements, it does not take away from the spiritual experience. We are not responsible for those times when spiritual experience was thought of as metaphysical. Everything is physical. Consciousness is the product of the functioning of the brain. Talking of scientific measurements is no damage to that wholeness of life which is present everywhere and which begins to be lived when the physiology is taking on a particular form. This is our understanding about spirituality: it is not on the level of faith --it is on the level of blood and bone and flesh and activity. It is measurable."" -Maharishi Mahesh Yogi",The problem is that the word 'spiritual' has more or less lost any and all agreed-upon meaning.  Any conclusions regarding or relating to spirituality are more or less merely semantic arguments.,"Well, mayhap. However, in the above quote, the ""spirituality"" referred to was involving the various enlightenment states descxribed by Patanjali in the seminal textbook on Yoga, the Yoga Sutras.  The point being that ""spirituality"" has traditionally been defined in mystical/philosophical terms because no tools were available to measure it. Now, according to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, we DO have the tools to measure how ""spiritual"" someone is, at least in terms of what is described in the Yoga Sutras.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.762096338

For example, people feel victimized, trampled on, or offended when being cheated on within 'sincere' relationships or marriages, because they believe, consciously or subconsciously, that they own the other exclusively when it comes to 'love' and intimacy.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/ExploreReligion.jsonl,ExploreReligion.jsonl,164dbe,What does submission actually mean in a religious context?,"Muslims believe that Islam means to submit to Allah and Christians advocate letting Jesus take the wheel.  What does this really mean? Can you give an example of how Allah or Jesus show you their will or direction in your life and how you submit to it? If it is shown to you somehow with a sign, how do you know the sign is true?","This means 2 things as far as I'm aware. One aspect is submitting to what Allah (swt) decrees for us. When something good happens or when something bad happens, we should say ""alhamdulilah"" (all praise and gratitude is to Allah swt). It means accepting that He knows what's best for us and we should be grateful for everything He has given us. For example, I prayed every day for 2 years for a full time job at my old school. Every day. I never got it, but I did get a full time job at a better school, so I had to accept that Allah swt knew what was best for me and gave me something better than what I had asked for. Basically,  submission is about being grateful and trusting one's Creator and Sustainer.   The second aspect is submitting to the commands He has laid out for us in the Qur'an and hadith. This means praying even when you are tired, fasting even if you are thirsty, smiling even if you are cranky, eating halal meat, being a good person, wearing hijab, etc. These are clearly laid out in the Sharia', but there are some issues of jurisprudence that vary from school to school and scholar to scholar. For issues where there is a difference of opinion, the principle is to follow those people of knowledge who you trust.","&gt;Basically, submission is about being grateful and trusting one's Creator and Sustainer.  I can understand expressing gratitude for everything after the fact, be it good or bad. IMHO, That is the takeaway from Job.  But looking at your example, I am confused what exactly you submitted to. You prayed for 2 years, a struggle in itself, even when your prayers went unanswered. Shouldn't you have conceded and given up after some amount of time, and assume that maybe Allah wants you to do something else with your life?  Another example: Say you are a farmer and months go by without rain. Without water your crops will die and you will not be able to harvest, and your family could starve in the winter. What do you do? Do you continue to pray for rain or do you concede that maybe Allah doesn't want you to be a farmer? Or do you concede and accept that ""Allah knows best"" and maybe is trying to purposely kill you and your family off for some cosmic unknown reason?",comment_2,Condescending Attitude,Condescending Attitude,,,,,No,0.834744561

[Corinthians] 15:3-8); the earliest conception of the risen Jesus was as the glorified, exalted Messiah, who appeared repeatedly to his followers ‚Ä¶ Compared with that evidence, the story of the empty tomb is apparently a later development, like the other evidence for a palpable, material body of the risen Lord (as in John 20:17, 20, 27; 21:13; etc. [and so on]).   Mark, however, does not stress the physical or material nature of Jesus‚Äô risen body; indeed, he does not present any account of a resurrection appearance ‚Äì and it is even possible, with Lohmeyer, to think that he referred (in vs. [verse] 7) not to a resurrection appearance in Galilee, but to the final Parousia which was to take place there, rather than in Jerusalem (see Lohmeyer *Galil”ìa und Jerusalem* [Galilee and Jerusalem]) ‚Ä¶ In fact, what we have in this section is only one of many accounts of the Resurrection, an account of only one feature in the story, the empty tomb, and that a relatively late one.‚Äù (Frederick C.

John has nothing to correspond to this verse ‚Ä¶ It is doubtful if the words **and Peter** belonged in the original interpolation; Matt. 28:7 omits them, despite the strong Petrine element in that Gospel ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Frederick C.

However, he is now a *penitent* ‚Äì tell him that Jesus is risen from the dead, and is ready to heal *his* backsliding ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Adam Clarke, 1831, v I, p. 321)   &amp;nbsp;     -8. And they went out and fled from the grave,    for seized them, trembling and bewilderment [◊ï◊™◊û◊î◊ï◊ü, *VeTheeMahHON*].    **And** to a man **they did not say a word**,    **for they were afraid** [◊ô◊®◊ê◊ï, *YahR‚ÄôOo*]. ‚Ä¶ [ellipses in the text]   &amp;nbsp;  &gt;‚Äú**And they said nothing** implied ‚Ä¶ that the discovery of the empty tomb had been kept a secret ‚Ä¶ and was disclosed only sometime later.  This would account for the lateness of the story.  Is it now being first related in Mark?  Their silence also helps us to account for the absence of any reference to the empty tomb in the earliest surviving literature in the N.T. [New Testament], e.g. [for example], in Paul, or indeed anywhere in the N.T. except in the Gospels.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;**For they were afraid**: Many readers have been impressed by this abrupt ending of the Gospel, and many theories have been advanced to account for it‚Ä¶ Attempts have been made to recover the ‚Äòlost ending‚Äô of Mark in the remaining sections of Matthew or Luke or even John or Acts; but none of these has been generally approved, and it is doubtful if Luke‚Äôs and Matthew‚Äôs copies of Mark went beyond 16:8.  The problem is a fascinating one for research; but it is probably insoluble at present.  Further discoveries of early MSS [manuscripts] may help toward a solution. ‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;One of the oldest attempts to supplement and finish Mark is the so-called ‚Äòlonger ending‚Äô (vss. [verses] 9-20).  This is not found in the best MSS (B ◊ê S *k* sys, etc.) and dates probably from the second century; it was compiled out of the data of the other Gospels, and even of Acts, and may have been an originally independent list of resurrection appearances.  The author was probably, as Burkitt and Conybeare held, the second century presbyter Aristion, or Aristo.  It is attributed to him in an Armenian MS [manuscript] written in 989.  There is also the so-called shorted ending.‚Äô Found in certain MSS (L Œ® 579 k and a few others).  It probably arose in Egypt in the fourth century‚Ä¶ For the text see RSV [Revised Standard Version]. ‚Ä¶ any reader can tell for himself that it is non-Marcan.‚Äù (Frederick C. Grant, 1951, vol.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/humanism.jsonl,humanism.jsonl,3j8tyr,Humanistic Buddhism?,"I've always been fascinated by Buddhism. Unlike most religions, Buddhism doesn't rely on gods or supernaturalism (although some branches emphasize gods and supernaturalism more than others), and it seems to be more focused on the here and now, rather than the afterlife. Plus, the Buddha's whole message can be summed up as ""Be a good person."" I can get behind that!  There are some things about Buddhism, however, that irk me. The first is the whole idea of karma. I know that actions have consequences, but it seems like most Buddhists describe karma as another form of supernatural retribution. Especially with the whole idea that if you've done bad in this life, you might be born with disabilities in your next life. Yeah, that's pretty much bullshit!  So yeah, what do you think?","I enjoy studying concepts from Buddhism, Taoism and East Asian philosophy - especially anything related to Alan Watts' interpretation of the Zen aesthetic (probably because he can make those concepts more understandable to my poor, clunky, science-based Western mind). I have a hard time navigating the raggedy edge where Eastern philosophy becomes Eastern religion... and I think it may be because they never felt there had to be a clearly defined border between the two - but like I said, I'm no expert.  I think there are many concepts from Zen Buddhism which mesh well with Secular Humanism - that can be said of a lot of other philosophical and religious systems as well - the trick is the language we use to describe the connections. Generally, I like to keep the concept of Humanism as simple as possible in my mind and in my descriptions of it to others - then if the subject of other philosophical / religious systems come up I can pull out specific parts that ""point back"" to humanism through their own cultural / historical context.  For instance, one of the primary revelations of the Buddha was that all of human existence was a sort of suffering (or based on suffering, or features suffering... I can't remember the exact translation) - this certainly ties in to the Humanist philosophy regarding our inherent responsibilities towards one another, our shared interest in reducing all human suffering over time.  As for Karma? Well, that's definitely magical thinking - but as with so many similar concepts it has a wonderful metaphorical truth about it that feels more like living poetry or art. It doesn't have to stand up to experimental science to be useful to us as a way of understanding our relationships with each other and the world... as long as no one gets punished for not having enough of it by some arbitrary ""karma police"".","The thing that butts up against humanism when you look at Buddhism is their lack of progression. Most Buddhist would say they are in a cycle of suffering and rebirth, and try to escape that by reaching a state of nirvana.  A devout Buddhist would do this by casting away material possessions, to free their minds from distractions.   So the problem here in my opinion is that you can achieve enlightenment in almost any way, and for them to say one has to do something to achieve Nirvana other than follow what's true to them, is misleading, and holds humanity back. What's the point of advanced research when we can be perfectly at peace in nature? There is little to no motivation for advancement as a species, and I for one believe life and humans are meant to live, and that requires technology in this harsh universe.  Karma is also a nice idea, in that in gives the same comfort as hell does for Christians, meaning that on some level you believe if you're a shitty person it will come back to you. Kinda pointless as a humanist because we know people can be flawed and without an actual judicial process, the evil ones who get away may never stop their actions.",comment_2,"Closed to Diverse Perspectives,

I was raised a Roman Catholic growing up, but have basically gotten away from that for reasons I won't bore you with.  That being said, I'm not sure exactly what category my newfound beliefs (""life stance"", ""worldview"", etc. ?) fall under - I kind of feel like I relate to some aspect of all of the following (from what little research on all of the following I've actually taken the time to do):  \- Deism  \- Secularism  \- (Secular?) Humanism  \- Anti-religion (at least ""organized religion"", I have no opposition to the concept of ""faith"" per se)  \- Agnosticism (definitely, weak/theistic agnosticism ""appeals"" to me)  &amp;  \- Apatheism     I'd talk to like a priest (or other spiritual leader) or something about this, but it feels like that would just be a waste of time because they wouldn't be trying to get me to find out/identify my ""true beliefs"", so much as they would be trying to tell me why i'm a sinner and convert me.","If someone truly believes in things that are not true, then that person does not have ""true beliefs"".","Well... Emmm, not all priests/pastors/spiritual leaders are the same. I've met many from different congregations... Many spiritual leaders are more open minded than you'd think. But as long as you keep putting everybody inside the same category you'll never find out. Truth be told, **narrow-mindedness** is a **human** characteristic, hence you'll find it in religious groups as much as you will in political factions, philosophical schools, psychological theories, or any other group of people.  I'll be honest. The majority of the people and priests that I've encountered during my years assisting to church groups are amazing folks (and they are the Church too). They have their flaws, as I have mine, but **their hearts are enormous** and always so welcoming or ready to be there for you if you need, which is a more rare quality. However, I do not see eye to eye with the Church in everything. I think its about time it gets a thoroughly evaluated update on many fields (**marriage after divorce**, **sexual intercourse outside the sacrament of marriage**, **homosexuality not being a psychological disease**, **the separation of the Church from state affairs -""give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's-**,**the grey areas regarding abortion**, **the patriarchal unconscious ""vices"" underlying some traditions in the Catholic Liturgy**, etc) in order to continue fulfilling its mission on Earth which is: to be able to respond to mankind's spiritual needs... And mankind's needs evolve as mankind evolves.  Also, I believe that faith and religion are not opposites but rather complements in discovering and understanding the universe around us.  So, maybe it helps you in seeing yourself this way too: I see myself like a component of an app  (the Church) that has evolved and updated **before the app itself**. I'm still part of it. I want to be part of it. I believe in its amazing potential... But, though I'm also still learning and continuously evolving, I'm a couple of steps ahead of it. And as long as the app as a whole does not update itself, most of that potential for good, for helping, for bringing a positive / constructive change onto the world, goes to waste because most people **nowadays** can't relate to views that belong to **medieval** times...

The title is a bit provocative, but is relevant to some concerns I have. The first paragraphs are below and the rest here: [https://thehumanistguild.blogspot.com/2019/07/lazy-atheists-and-smug-humanists.html](https://thehumanistguild.blogspot.com/2019/07/lazy-atheists-and-smug-humanists.html)  **Lazy Atheists and Smug Humanists**  I think we Humanists need something extra, a bit of zing, a bit of a turbo charge, that missing ingredient. Humanism, is to me is the most sensible approach to the one life we live; but I wonder¬†if¬†we are not quite there yet, or perhaps that some of us need to travel to the next destination.  What you might ask has that to do with the title above? Well...  Growing up my family were all religious, we discussed and debate our beliefs (particularly my mother and me). We were interested in understanding our faith, what was ethically ""right and wrong"" and what was true. Ultimately this, handed down curiosity, resulted in my digging too deep into the faith in which I was raised, through the bottom to the empty underside, discovering to my surprise (and shock) that I had become an atheist. There was however in my family one person that had never believed in Christianity.¬† However there was a difference in approach: they didn't study any of the literature, debate or discuss. Seemingly rejecting our families Catholic and Baptist traditions from dislike, not reason or ethics. As one by one we each dropped our religious belief, she uttered words to the effect of ""see I was right"". From our current standpoint one has to agree, but the thought occurs that she had been right for the wrong reason.¬†   This may sound petulant but from a Humanistic point of view, holding beliefs on basis of convenience or preference is a dangerous position to take. To use the example of extremes: one might like the feeling of superiority over another race, and thus subscribe to racism, or perhaps buy into a point of view on vaccinations because gives a simple tangible answer for a child‚Äôs autism. The position of ""atheism from convenience"" or a reluctance to look closer at matters philosophical, I have in the past harshly categorised as ""Lazy Atheism"".¬† It could similarly apply to those raised atheist but haven't looked into it. I¬†pass no moral judgement on this, just hold that (to borrow a phrase) this is a house built upon the on sand.  The other side of the coin is ""Smug Humanism"",...

While it is true that there are religious people out there who actively fuel this narrative through their own actions, I would argue that the distinction between the average atheist/humanist and the intellectually lazy, edgelord, r/atheism type you describe is usually the willingness to respect theology and religion, and people's sincere belief in them, without having to believe in those things one's self; it is not a coincidence that the same is true when making similar arguments within religions (ie, the more someone argues that their religious interpretation is the ONLY valid one, and everyone else is stupid/possessed/etc, the more likely they are to be intellectually lazy).","I too grew up religious, then moved into atheism through the logic and understanding process.  I'm not sure I've encountered a lazy atheist as described above, but I suspect they exist. But I'm not sure it is fair to expect an atheist to engage in discussion and debate over something they see as fictional and made-up. That would be similar to expecting them debate you on your favorite Harry Potter book, then calling them lazy when they refuse.

Both Buddhism and Stoicism seem to share a fundamental principle that desire robs us of our peace, which is why I think it's relevant in both subreddits, and I'd like to hear where Buddhism and Stoicism might differ on this. I'm new to these ideas, so there's a good chance I'm missing something.  **What, if anything, is wrong with this argument?**  1. Desire and dissatisfaction prevent us from living peacefully (because of hedonic adaptation / distraction from the present). 2. To live peacefully, one must understand and escape desire and dissatisfaction - or, at least, the less noble desires. (Perhaps it's fine to desire to be more level-headed, or practise meditation more often, or something?) 3. Desire and dissatisfaction spur progress against the odds and innovative approaches to solving certain problems, leading to 'success': a positive impact on the world. 4. Without desire and dissatisfaction, it would be difficult to be motivated, to think in innovative ways, and to keep trying and iterating - often against the odds - until one succeeds at some aim. (If one were truly accepting of things as they were, where would the impetus be to bother, especially when things got tough?) 5. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between peace and impact. The presence of desire/dissatisfaction is necessary for impact, and its absence is necessary for peace.  **Notes**  1. I use 'impact' as a loose term instead of 'success', since success can be understood in so many ways. But examples here could include a successful company or a successful philosophical or scientific investigation (due to dissatisfaction with previous hypotheses?). 2. I noticed this apparent tradeoff when I was doing some exams recently. It was only when I felt there was little chance of achieving the top grade that I was able to really make peace with the fact that I might achieve lower results than I wanted. 3. Naval Ravikant writes, 'Happiness is being satisfied with what you have. Success comes from dissatisfaction. Choose.' Is he correct? 4. I'm not sure I understand the difference between 'desire' and 'attachment', but perhaps this difference is relevant to resolving this apparent tradeoff.  I would be very happy to hear your thoughts. Thank you!","What sort of impact are you asking about?

Al-Maghazi of M≈´sƒÅ b.  øUqbah b. Abƒ´  øAyyƒÅsh,"All Praise is to Allah, in the [Fall of 2021](https://twitter.com/abhistoria/status/1441399821307367426), it was announced that they found a unique manuscript of ""*Al-Maghazi of M≈´sƒÅ b.  øUqbah b. Abƒ´  øAyyƒÅsh*"" (d. 141/758AD).   The work has recently been published in [Arabic](https://twitter.com/HarunSSaleh/status/1679602769060147200), but now is also being prepared to be published in [English](https://twitter.com/DaralArqamPub/status/1681476006970814464)!  The  last time someone had access to this work was centuries ago, and it was  non-extant until its recent rediscovery; allegedly it was dusting away  inside of a manuscript house until some researcher stumbled upon it.  **Why is this work special?**  1) It is the earliest Seerah work, predating Ibn Ishaq's (probably by 25-35 years).  Ibn Ishaq (b. 704 AD) was commissioned by Al-Mansur to write a book from the time of Adam AS until his time, and it was entitled: ""*Al-Mubtada æ wa al-Ba øth wa al-MaghƒÅzƒ´*"".  This would mean he wrote the work in the later portion in his life, during the reign of Al-Mansur who reigned between 753-774 AD. The parts regarding the prophetic biography survived in parts and was later  compiled and into a work called ""*Sirat Rasullah* (Ô∑∫)"". Ibn Ishaq was not a hadith specialist and was criticized by various scholars regarding his strength in this field.  Later  on, Ibn Hisham redacted and filtered much of what was in Ibn Ishaq's  prophetic biography when he created his own work on prophetic biography  called "" *As-Sƒ´rah an-Nabawiyyah* ""  2) The *Maghazi* of Musa ibn Uqbah is special because is written by someone who was a Junior Tabi'een ([Musa bin Uqbah met companions](https://ar.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%89_%D8%A8%D9%86_%D8%B9%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A9)). Musa was born before 68AH, He reports that he was with Ibn Umar in Makkah in the year of [Najda's](https://ar.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%A8%D9%86_%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%86%D9%81%D9%8A) pilgrammage, which Al-Tabari states was in the year 68AH.   3)  He was praised and considered pious by the authorities of the Salaf,  and he was recognized for his accuracy in hadith and memorization.Imam  Malik said about it *‚ÄúI recommend the Maghazi of the pious man Musa Ibn Uqbah because it is the most accurate of Maghazi works*‚Äù.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/ChristianApologetics.jsonl,ChristianApologetics.jsonl,g3y0h0,[Classical] Is God Evil for Creating Someone He Knew Would Go to Hell?,"""Is God evil for creating someone He knew would go to hell?""  To this I would say: Is it the judge's fault if *you* break a law and reject His offer of mercy?  No.  This is ultimately a free will question. Logically speaking, God can't make you love him because love is freely given. He wanted to create creatures that would love Him back, so he gave them free will. It's their fault if they decide not to turn to Him. Not God's.  None of this is to say, however, that God can't still get His will done through evil people. Every Christian understands this but non-believers usually don't because they don't have as firm a grasp on Christian beliefs. So a good example I would bring up would be something like Joseph in Genesis.  Joseph's own family sold him into slavery to Egypt. However, that eventually turned into him getting into a position of prominence. Since God knows past, present, and future, He warns Joseph of a coming famine. So, Joseph stocks up on grain and puts it aside in case there is a famine. Then there¬†*is*¬†a famine, and Joseph's family comes to Egypt to escape said famine. They go to Egypt not knowing that Joseph is in the position he is, and begs him for food. Joseph sees them and (essentially) says ""You sold me into slavery. You meant it for evil. But God meant it for good, by the saving of many lives that is going on right now."" Joseph then saves and forgives the very same family that sinned against him, and saves many others along with them.   We all have atheists in our bloodlines. I'm a pretty good example of this. My dad is a very staunch atheist. I, obviously, am not. If my dad never met my mom, I would not have been born. God can get His will done and turn something bad into good. But it's not God's fault if someone continues to harden their own heart towards Him. I was much like my dad for most my life. That changed now. If I could change, so could my dad. He decides not to though, (as much as it grieves me).  But this still begs the question. ""Is God evil for creating someone He knew wouldn't turn to Him?""  Well, is God morally obligated to not create a universe where even one person rejects Him? No, of course not. If He creates a universe and there's two Christians and one atheist, God is not suddenly obligated to *not* create that universe. It might not even be realistic for Him to create a world where there were only believers who *freely* chose to believe. If He did make such a world, it would be a rather small world considering He wouldn't allow for Christians to be born from atheists (since no atheists could even exist in this kind of world). Why would God keep so many potential believers from the gift of being eternally in His presence just because their parents might've refused to accept that gift themselves? God created me knowing I would become Christian, but He also created my dad knowing he would be an atheist. Thus, even though God can know someone would reject Him ahead of time (due to Him being outside of time), He is not culpable at all if someone *freely* denies Him.  If you are really struggling with how God is sovereign and yet we have free will, try molinism. Molinism teaches that God does not only have knowledge about the past, present, and future, but also has middle knowledge. For example, He knows what would've caused you not to believe in Him in world X versus what would've caused you to believe in Him in world Y. So, God has created a world set in motion from the beginning to save as many people as possible through people's free actions. This is how there is an ""elect,"" and yet we have free will. Some complain that molinism is just calvinism with extra steps because some are obviously left out of this plan (I.E. those that chose not to believe in this specific world). However, I just explained why it's not God's fault at all if someone goes to hell.  Some Scriptural support for molinism would be the following verses:  ‚Ä¢ 1 Samuel 23:8-14  ‚Ä¢ Proverbs 4:11  ‚Ä¢ Matthew 23:11  ‚Ä¢ Ezekiel 3:6-7  ‚Ä¢ Jeremiah 38:17-18  ‚Ä¢ 1 Corinthians 2:1-8  ‚Ä¢ Deuteronomy 28:51-57  ‚Ä¢ Matthew 23:27-32  ‚Ä¢ Matthew 12:7  ‚Ä¢ Matthew 24:43  ‚Ä¢ Luke 16:30-31  ‚Ä¢ Luke 22:67-68  ‚Ä¢ Matthew 17:27  ‚Ä¢ John 21:6  ‚Ä¢ John 15:22-24  ‚Ä¢ John 18:36  ‚Ä¢ Matthew 26:24  ‚Ä¢ John 9:41","God doesn't know someone will go to hell or not. Foreknowledge is impossible if we have free will, which we do.","Hell is simply the absence of God's presence, which is horrific since God is the source of all good. However, in this life we live inside of time, through free will made possible by God, we are allowed to decide if we love God and want to be with Him outside of time (""eternally""), or if we hate him and want to be away from Him ""eternally"". In light of this, your question should be rephrased to ""**Is God evil for creating someone God knew would not love Him and would want to be away from Him outside of time?**"" Is God wrong for giving us what we ultimately want, to either be with Him or not?",comment_1,,Closed to Diverse Perspectives,,,,,No,0.3095736774

My brother is the pastor of the church I once attended, and am still technically a member of. It's a very, very strict sect of Baptist. I talked to him about rescinding my membership (I'm not at all close with my brother, so it was a semi-hostile discussion), and he said that it has never been done before; either people move their memberships, or they are brought up in a deacon's meeting for ""denying the faith"" and are excluded.   My brother and I reached sort of a compromise-- women are not allowed to speak in business meetings; they must get a man to represent them. I proposed that I attend the deacon's meeting where they talk about my exclusion, and articulate my reasons for leaving, and be there when the exclude me. He said this made sense.  The deacon called me today to say that is not possible, and it would have to be brought up in a business meeting. I said ""okay, so I would be able to articulate my reason for leaving, because I'm a member and I'm speaking about my own membership. Right?""  ""Well... our procedure doesn't allow for that.""  ""Because I'm a woman.""  ""Yes, our procedure doesn't allow women to speak in business meetings. That's just how it is.""  ""I made a conscious decision to join the church, I should be able to make a conscious decision to leave it. You're saying that a legally consenting adult in the state of Maryland cannot talk in a church business meeting because your sexist procedures don't allow for it?""  ""well, I can speak for you. To say, you know, that for whatever reason you've suddenly decided god doesn't exist anymore.""  ""I am a member of your church, I deny your doctrines, your god, and your procedures. This is not a sudden decision; I've been trying to get my membership off your books for almost five years now. I would like to articulate my own reason.""  ""Well, you can't do that.""  After several minutes of this, he gave me a ""well, if you don't want to be involved in the proceedings (...how *CAN* I be? They won't let me talk!) we'll just go on with the exclusion without you, since obviously what you're describing to me is that you don't believe in god and that is grounds for exclusion. But you're always welcome to come back.""  I gave him a cheerful ""I won't, and this is part of the reason why I'm attempting to severe all affiliation with your church in the first place. Goodbye.""  I called my brother to re-discuss the compromise we'd talked about before, and he went all hardened christian asshole on me. No, you can't attend the meeting, no, you can't talk in business meeting, all you want to do is make some statement and cause a scene, and we can't allow that. Just quietly be excluded.  It angers me that they won't let me have a say in my own membership because of my gender. It angers me that they're perpetuating their bigotry, and my brother will raise his kids this way, and the cycle of ignorance will just keep going.  It angers me that reason has no effect whatsoever on them. And it never will, because they propagate this ignorance and block out everything else. Fuck this, fuck churches, fuck religion.

The dispute amongst theologians is basically summarized dealing with the authority of Jesus and his relationship to God.   One definition of LOGOS is word which legitimizes Jesus as the word of God. But when you look up the word logos in a lexicon you will find many different definitions. A lot of them or dealing with word or discourse however there are some that say the divine/universal principle of reason. There is a Note at the end of the definition citing a reference of the first known use of the word LOGOS G3056 by Heraclitus in the 6th century BCE and I will note that other philosophers used the term in the context 500+ years before John.   Saint John is said to have preached this Gospel in Ephesus (a Ionian Greek colony in Asia Minor) which has Greek roots. One great monument here was The Library of Celsus built by the Romans in the 1st century BCE. Aristotle‚Äôs work 2 centuries before this would have been prominent at this library.   Aristotle has a work called Rhetoric in which he outlines the 3 appeals when trying to persuade someone in a argument. Those 3 appeals make up the rhetorical triangle. Aristotle systematically changed the use of the word LOGOS to make it mean Reasoned Word to go with an argument. The 3 appeals are Ethos, Pathos, Logos.","Yes, John was a synthesis of Hebrew story telling and Hellenistic philosophy.  However, logos is a concept and word that was fairly common at the time.

I wholeheartedly believe that suicide is NEVER the answer.  That said, it's always sort of bothered me that Christianity teaches that people who commit suicide just instantly go to Hell no matter what.  I mean, I understand that we're supposed to go to God with our problems. But sometimes, for whatever reason, people cease to see that as an option.  Would a loving God really show no mercy to someone who was struggling with problems, be they problems in their personal lives or with mental illnesses, and wanted to escape it all? Even if they were kind, positive, loving people in their lives?  I don't want to think that people like Robin Williams or Etika or the countless LGBT+ youth who took their lives because of bullying/unsupportive families would just be burning in Hell right now after all the suffering they had to go through in life.  It just seems wrong. At least to me.  But what do you think?","My opinion is that that doctrine was sort of a necessary result of the messed up theology of thinking of heaven as a reward we get for enduring life in a Godly way, rather than thinking of our purpose as bringing about God's kingdom on Earth.  Once you start thinking about life as bad, and heaven as good, you start getting people asking things like ""shouldn't I just kill myself so I can go there now?"" and ""isn't it a service to kill babies right after we baptize them?"" and other messed up stuff like that. In order to survive as a philosophy, a religion needs an answer to that, and ""suicide is a mortal sin that you don't have a chance to repent of"" was the answer.  In short, I think that bad theology resulted in obviously bad conclusions, and that the ideas around suicide were used to band-aid those conclusions instead of fixing the root cause.","I will probably decline treatment if diagnosed with a terminal illness; as a chronic depressive, my body is starting to break down as middle-age sets in (49m) and symptoms become physically manifest.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/Buddhism.jsonl,Buddhism.jsonl,kva0rx,"Best teachings to start with? Plus some ""academic"" questions...","Hello,  I have been practicing meditation for a month now to help manage my anxiety disorder. In that time I have also been learning about Buddhism. I have read Thich Naht Hanh's ""The Heart of the Buddha's Teachings"" and his translation/commentary of the Heart Sutra. I just started reading the Dhammapada translated and introduced by Eknath Easwaran.  A few questions I have:  * Eknath's translation is part of a collection of other Indian scripture including the Bhagvad Gita and the Upanishads. Are these also considered Buddhist or are they something else?  * I am interested in reading some of the early texts of Buddhism. I have heard of the Pali Canon, but there is also Chinese and Tibetan Canon? How are these different? Would these be considered the earliest written buddhist texts? If not, what is? Does Mahayana recognize the Pali Canon?  * What are some key Mahayana sutras and how do they relate to certain sects? I have heard of the Heart, Diamond, and Lotus sutras, and also something called Pure Land Sutras. Do all mahayana sects recognize all of the sutras, and some just put emphasis on different ones? Or do certain sects regard some sutras as not authentic or canon?  Thank you!","&gt; Eknath's translation is part of a collection of other Indian scripture including the Bhagvad Gita and the Upanishads. Are these also considered Buddhist or are they something else?  Something else (Hindu).  &gt; I am interested in reading some of the early texts of Buddhism. I have heard of the Pali Canon, but there is also Chinese and Tibetan Canon? How are these different? Would these be considered the earliest written buddhist texts? If not, what is? Does Mahayana recognize the Pali Canon?  The Chinese and Tibetan canons include pretty much all the material that became part ofthe Pali canon as well as a lot of other stuff. So people who use these canons would recognise the Pali canon's authenticity, but they're initially based on the Sanskrit versions of the texts. The Pali canon is the oldest extant *complete* canon but I believe older texts from other traditions do exist as well. I'm sure a scholar would be able to give you a far superior answer here.  I'm not even going to attempt to answer the third question lmao.","&gt; Are these also considered Buddhist or are they something else?  Those are Hindu texts.  &gt; How are these different? Would these be considered the earliest written buddhist texts? If not, what is?  The common core of the three major forms of the canons is called the Agamas or the Nikayas (only called this in Pali), and comprises of about 4 books. The Chinese and Tibetan canons then also share some different classes of texts among each other, and have some unique texts themselves.  All three canons rely on a different Vinaya section, and Theravada has a separate Abhidhamma, while the Chinese and Tibetan canons more-or-less agree on what constitutes valid Abhidharma (though do not technically have 'canonical' Abhidharma sections themselves).  It is the common core and the vinaya texts alone that are called the ""earliest Buddhist texts."" However, you add the qualifier *written* and that complicates things--in general, you should not use that qualifier when discussing academic Buddhist texts, because the earliest *written* texts are... almost all of the written texts. A lot of the earliest known written Buddhist texts are Mahayana texts. Until 2019, the earliest known written Buddhist text *was* a Mahayana text, even though we also *know* it is composed at a later date than what we call the ""Early Buddhist Texts.""  There are four or five centuries of oral transmission, so ""early Buddhist text"" and ""early written Buddhist text"" refer to different things.  &gt; Does Mahayana recognize the Pali Canon?  It recognizes the Chinese Agamas, which share many common texts with the Pali Nikayas, and in some cases are nearly for word-for-word matches, but there are considerable differences. So no Mahayana tradition recognizes the Pali canon, as much of the Pali canon is later, and a lot of the canon is not considered canonical by the other canons. But there is a common core of four books, plus some overlap in the vinayas, apadanas, and some other texts.  &gt; What are some key Mahayana sutras and how do they relate to certain sects?  This is too broad a question for an easy answer. I would honestly ignore sects when it comes to Mahayana traditions until you're more familiar with Buddhism in general--the ""sects"" do not really matter. In general, the differences relate to differences in practice traditions, not really doctrinal exegesis.   &gt; Do all mahayana sects recognize all of the sutras, and some just put emphasis on different ones?  Correct.  &gt; Or do certain sects regard some sutras as not authentic or canon?  I cannot speak for the Tibetan tradition, but my experience with the Sinitic tradition is that every text said to be authentic by any tradition--*any* tradition--is authentic to some degree, with the exception of the Abhidharma texts, and the Sinitic tradition just has the best *versions* of those texts. Where the Sinitic tradition does not have a version of a text, it defers authority to the tradition that does.",comment_1,,"Provides clarifying comments, Recognizes limitations in one‚Äôs own knowledge or beliefs",,,,,No,0.2029149006
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/islam.jsonl,islam.jsonl,16f7zre,Atheist Woman and Muslim Man,"I'm coworkers with a Muslim man who I've gotten to know over time, and I've come to appreciate him as a human being. He's kind, considerate, generous, hardworking, funny... I could go on and on. The topic of religion naturally comes up pretty regularly, him being a practicing Muslim and me coming from a fundamentalist Christian upbringing, now atheist but still find faith/religion interesting. I've made it clear to him that I'm steadfastly atheist. I have a distinct lack of belief in the existence of God. I respect people who believe in God though. I get it. The denomination I was raised in doesn't baptize children and I became an atheist before the ""age of accountability"" (early 20s in that denomination), so I was technically never Christian, but I *was* a believer growing up. I know how it feels, how powerful faith can be. He's been respectful in return but has posited that he thinks if I were to just give the Quran a try, it would resonate with me. But I *have* read passages, and they haven't moved me like that. It's hard for someone with faith to grasp my lack of it, especially if they believe in fitrah.  But we've clicked since day one. There's an ease between us. We can talk, debate, laugh, or just sit in silence with it feeling totally comfortable. Gradually, it became clear that there was a physical attraction as well and things started to get flirtatious and suggestive. He invited me out to dinner a couple times but I'd decline because of this obvious religious incompatibility between us. But the flirting never really stopped. He playfully threatened to drag me to his mosque, said I'd go on hajj one day with him, we joked about how many children we'd have and what we'd name them.  We were sent on a work trip together recently. Took a company car, stayed at the same hotel. You can probably guess where this is leading. We went on a hike after work one day and it lit a match. We caved and slept together multiple times. And it wasn't just sex but intimacy, which is honestly more dangerous. It was like we created a little pocket dimension where we got to live like a married couple. And it was wonderful, even just watching him brush his teeth and get dressed and fantasizing that I got to enjoy that sight every morning. I can't bring myself to feel guilty for causing him to stumble and sin because every moment felt so right. I'd been celibate since 2020 following an abusive relationship and being with him was healing. Everything he said and did was like a balm.  I can tell he wants tawbah, to make this pure and sincere, and the obvious route to him is to move us towards legitimacy. On the ride back from the work trip he gingerly broached the topic. His mother is visiting soon and he wants to introduce us. He wants to get married. I pointed out to him that we're ultimately not compatible because I'm an atheist and he seemed pained by it.  I am too. I want to be with him. I want to explore the possibility of marriage. But I'm not even ""of the Book"". He can't marry me unless I convert. I'm at a crossroads now and I'm struggling. He's everything I've ever wanted and we could have the life together I've always wanted. Ever since I was a little girl I dreamed of marrying a good man and starting a family together and raising babies. But the older I got the more my dream died. All the Western men I encounter have the unrealistic expectation that their wife should at least hold down a part time job and pay as close to 50% of all the bills as possible whilst also carrying the pregnancies, birthing the babies, rearing the children, cleaning the home, cooking the meals, and managing the household. Meanwhile the husband gets to foster substance abuse issues and video game/pornography addictions. He's talked unprompted about how messed up that is, how if the woman is doing everything at home it'd be ridiculous to expect her to work outside it, and if she chooses to hold down a job then her money is her money. My ex was a lazy financial leech so hearing this from him was so refreshing.  Additionally, I come from a really messed up childhood. My parents were not good Christians, they were abusive and neglectful. Popped out a bunch of kids because of quiverfull ideology, not because they ardently wanted us or would love and cherish us. And their mistreatment poisoned us all. I'm no contact with my father, low contact with my mother, and only speak to one sibling because I love my nephews and I have to maintain cordiality with her if I want to see them. I haven't met his family, but the picture he's painted is idyllic. A big, happy, loving family. Community. I haven't gone into extreme detail with him about my background but what I have told him seems like such an alien concept to him. Like he can't grasp how a parent could possibly not love their child, or how a sibling could participate in the neglect and abuse of their little sister. You can tell when someone was raised in safety, love, and security, and he definitely was. I wouldn't just be marrying him, I'd be marrying his family. If they are indeed like what he's told me, I could be very happy. I crave having a family like that.  But still, I am an atheist. And even though I can see a future with him, and feel like fulfillment is right at my fingertips, I don't want to be dishonest. Islam isn't like Judaism, which I've gathered allows you to count yourself a member as long as you practice even if you don't actually *believe*. If it were, I would convert. But Islam requires actual belief, no? If I were to declare the shahada and practice the other pillars, I would be lying to everyone around me. I want him but not at the cost of my honesty. I do feel a ""stirring"" when I think about belonging/oneness, but I think that's a natural human compulsion to encourage group bonding and I think it gets utilized (for good and sometimes bad) by religion for social control. The concept of an omnipotent cosmic entity is the stuff of fairytales to me. I can't reconcile a world in which Daisy's Destruction and the murders of Anush Apetyan and Junko Furuta occurred if there's a merciful creator.  I apologize for the length and appreciate if you've read any of it. Typing this all out has helped me process some of my thoughts and emotions. I'm open to all opinions, advice, and guidance. As much as I want him, and as much as I'm tempted not to, I feel that I should cut him loose. We're ultimately not compatible because of faith/religion, and that's okay. I don't want to lead him on or give him false hope. We made plans to go on a hike next weekend. Am I right in thinking now that's not a good idea? I know he'll view it, and any future time spent together, as an opportunity to coax me towards Islam. I'm flattered that he sees so much potential in me. It makes me start tearing up if I think too long on the fact that he'd even want to marry me, I'm such damaged goods. But I don't think I'm swayable. Is it fair to keep spending time with him if I think it's a dead end, that we'll both just end up hurt?","Islam is the furthest thing from fairy tales. One of the most prominent themes in the Qur‚Äôan is logic and critical thinking. Islam is based on facts and logic, having blind faith is completely incorrect.

With that said, I would encourage you to re-evaluate Islam critically. I was an Atheist as well and was set out to disprove Islam by finding contradictions and mocking its fairy tale-like stories. Eventually, I caved in. Even during my weakest moments in life, I knew there is a God. This existence did not just beautifully come about without cause.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/ExploreReligion.jsonl,ExploreReligion.jsonl,19nm4g,The Law of Religious Tolerance,"From Robert Wright's The Evolution of God:  &gt;Attitudes toward a foreign god can depend on how the foreigners are perceived. If locals feel they can gain by cooperative interaction with those foreigners, they may embrace the god, or at least raise no protest when fellow citizens do. But if locals see the game as zero-sum--if they believe that their fortunes are inversely correlated with the foreigners' fortunes, that the foreigners have to lose for them to win--then their theology will probably be less inclusive. Let's call this the law of religious tolerance: people are more likely to be open to foreign gods when they see themselves playing a non-zero-sum game with foreigners--see their fortunes as positively correlated with the foreigners' fortunes, see themselves and the foreigners as, to some extent, in the same boat.  &gt;The ancient world, by linking foreign policy and theology so tightly, make this principle especially compelling, but a version of it operates in modern times, too. People who are profitably doing business with other people tend not to question their religious beliefs: live and let live.  &gt;For that matter, the basic dynamic goes beyond the question of religious tolerance to the question of tolerance in general. People naturally, without really thinking about it, judge enemies and rivals critically in various realms. If two men are pursuing the same woman, and you ask them what they think of each other's tastes--in politics, in clothes, in literature, whatever--you'll probably get some negative feedback, and it will probably be heartfelt. In contrast, people reflexively judge potential collaborators, and their beliefs, leniently. So the link between self-interest and tolerance needn't be a matter of *conscious* calculation, a fact we'll explore below. The law of religious tolerance grows organically out of human nature.  So here's the question: When instances of religious violence or intolerance hit the news, most people blame the religion in question because their theologies inspired animosity. Should we instead consider the opposite? That animosity inspired the exclusivist theologies, and we need to be looking for other factors to explain the animosity?","&gt;So here's the question: When instances of religious violence or intolerance hit the news, most people blame the religion in question because their theologies inspired animosity.

I wouldn't ever reduce it to a one way street (ie: it's always a theology that inspires animosity or it's always animosity that inspires theology), I think that this often the most accurate and helpful approach to take. We often make serious mistakes in our analysis when we start from religion in-itself because religion never exists in-itself.","I think the religion isn't to blame at all, other then a few small examples most religions at their core provide positive ideals to live up to.

Be there at the scheduled time, and pick yourself a spot over to the side so you can observe but not feel like you are in anyone‚Äôs way.  When others go up to communion, stay in your spot and take it all in as an observer.  When the liturgy is over, unless someone comes over to say hi, let yourself linger a little bit, and maybe get a chance to speak to one of the acolytes or clergy.  Mostly, be yourself, as the humble and welcome guest!   May I ask what jurisdiction you will be attending? That will help to tell you some of the quirks to observe and be ready for.","It‚Äôs perfectly fine for people to feel nervous; however, most Orthodox parishes in this country are used to non-Orthodox persons visiting. People come in at varying times throughout the Divine Liturgy, and so people are generally just focused on what‚Äôs going on during worship. Plus there are ‚Äúcradle‚Äù Orthodox Christians who don‚Äôt know precisely what to do during the service, so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.   My advice to you would be to show up and simply observe everything ‚Äî because it can be overwhelming for non-Orthodox to attempt to follow along in the Divine Liturgy books in the pews. Just let everything soak in and don‚Äôt worry about doing everything ‚Äúcorrectly.‚Äù You won‚Äôt do everything correctly and no one usually cares. Of course you wouldn‚Äôt go up for Holy Communion, but you may go forward at the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy to receive a piece of blessed bread from the priest (which is called ‚ÄúAntidoron‚Äù). That‚Äôs usually when you‚Äôll introduce yourself to the priest as a visitor. Usually there‚Äôs a coffee hour or time of fellowship following the Divine Liturgy, and it would be great if you could linger in order to meet the people.",comment_2,,"Provides clarifying comments, Mindful of others‚Äô feelings",,,,,No,0.6624819153

I am starting to feel like we need to stop combining two issues. On one hand, we have the fact that another person was murdered by a police officer. On the other, equally important hand, we have the fact that, like many of those murdered by police officers, he wasn't white. Both of these separate issues have combined as they often do, but this time, for whatever reason, the attention garnered is immense.    The racially influenced injustices that plague people all over the world seem worse than they have ever been, but I think the fact that people like me are aware of them is actually a good sign. The internet is allowing privileged hipster douches like myself to see the gross inhumanities on earth which can inspire me to do my little part to combat them. The more aware of these issues that we become, the harder it will be for them to remain in their current form. As bad as it seems, the optimist in me feels as if the quality of human rights is as high as it has ever been, and it will continue to improve forever, as long as we stay informed and creative.     Police brutality and the rise of the police state is something that seems to grow on its own, and we must actively fight to keep it from growing into something that we won't be able to stop. It is one of those things that I feel almost helpless to do anything about personally, but I have confidence in those more qualified than I to organize or educate the people to help us move in the right direction. It seems easy to blame police as individuals for their misconduct (murder of innocents) but in reality, police brutality is a element of a system we are a part of. If we are going to insist upon living in a society that is so broken that we can't imagine how it could operate without a small army policing it, then we might just need to reexamine how we interact with that army, and what standards we hold it to. After all, our taxes pay their damn paychecks.    I imagine that civil rights never got this kind of press in the pre-internet era. We now have control over what we can learn about and what we can influence. Of course a single person's influence is not so great, but we are all still snowflakes in an avalanche. When we stick together and move in the same direction we can really change things. We can make a difference, but only through learning from our ancestors' mistakes and from our own.","I really wish calling the grand jury's decision a ""verdict"" hadn't caught on.

In the interest of full disclosure, Skarykidd kindly approved me as a moderator, but I hope no one minds me participating.  If you haven't heard of Mormons, we're kind of an off-shoot from mainstream Protestant Christianity. We believe that the chain of ""Priesthood"" authority given to Peter and the Apostles from Christ was broken, and restored by Christ to our founder Joseph Smith in the early 1800's. Smith penned a brief overview of our core beliefs, which we call ""[The Articles of Faith](http://lds.org/library/display/0,4945,106-1-2-1,FF.html)"".  Smith and later LDS prophets also added and expounded on various doctrines, some of which have put us at odds with mainstream Christians. Not to sound like a martyr, but some of our beliefs have made us prime targets for mockery and derision in the media and elsewhere, so you've probably heard a few weird things at some point or another.  I'm a lifelong Mormon, been a dedicated missionary for two years and held a few positions in Church service. As I've said, I try to keep a ""No Bullshit"" zone and give straight answers, so feel free to ask anything you're curious about.","I have had the pleasure of working with a very devout Mormon in my works in the IT field, I have never actually met one that is any where near what moron are described as.  From the conversations I had with him about religion, I came to understand that most of the things people mock Mormon's for are either traditions that the mainstream Moron church does not follow (polygamy), and the rest are no more different than what the Amish and Quaker's do.   If I am totally off please let me know.","I'd say you're pretty close to the mark. Stuff like Polygamy was renounced by the Church in 1890, I believe, and even before that it was a fairly limited practice; it wasn't like everyone and their dog were piling on the wives, or anything. There's a few offshoots that still do it (like the FLDS) ~~but they're not officially recognized.~~  Still, some of the ""odd"" stuff is at least partially true.   *Edit for arrogance",comment_1,"Provides clarifying comments,

My question is, if we can remember events from our childhood, youth, and old age, why can't we remember memories from our previous lives?  My current understanding is that it's not the self but rather our physical body that retains memories. Once the body is gone, the memories are lost as well.

However, I am curious as why Simone Weil is so certain that God is the god of the Abrahamic tradition (or, for that matter, any specific monotheistic or specific set of polythestic gods) if Weil believes that God is radically anterior to what we experience as the world.

Relatedly, how would you attempt to demonstrate that Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah is who he said he is?","Regarding your second question:  There's no magical formula for expounding the teachings of Baha'u'llah to the point of demonstrating His legitimacy (I see this as conversion). Each individual has a unique life situation and stage in their spiritual growth. I've shifted my thinking lately on the subject of teaching. It is our duty to teach but not to convert people. This quote shares a little about how to share our faith and that is to live the life; there's nothing in there that says how to teach, how to explain things, etc. If we don't live the life, how can we show people what the fruits of this belief system represent?  ""This is the Day when every ear must needs be attentive to His voice. Hearken ye to the Call of this wronged One, and magnify ye the name of the one true God, and adorn yourselves with the ornament of His remembrance, and illumine your hearts with the light of His love. This is the key that unlocketh the hearts of men, the burnish that shall cleanse the souls of all beings.""  Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h, Gleanings from the Writings of Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h, p. 203  As for your first question, I personally grew up in a Baha'i household but I grew up with many questions and some degree of agnosticism. It was only until I went to serve in the Baha'i World Centre in Israel some 20 years ago that I started to join a study group with a House of Justice member that I figured, hey, I've never read more than a quote here and there or done some basic research. Let me see what I can draw from reading a book for more than just a few pages. I grew up in a place that didn't really give value to reading, so I wasn't used to it. I think I picked up Gleanings or some other book that had a compilation of writings and I read it for more than an hour and the more I read, the fewer the doubts I had and in that very afternoon, I came to the conclusion that there was no way that Baha'u'llah could produce such coherent, world fixing, etc. writings alone as a human and had to had received divine revelation. There was no way he would come up with this beautiful system that can fix the world for some kind of personal profit as He was already very wealthy to begin with and gave it up for what, 40 years? Why would a person be able to produce such beautiful writings, teachings, laws, etc. consistently for 40 years in search for personal gain where the more he did, the more oppressed he and his family became. I had seen other people who claim to be divine quickly get drunken by power and wealth and eventually get wrapped up in scandals. None of this happened with Baha'u'llah. That was my reasoning behind it. After that happened, I was in a state of amazement for nearly two weeks. Everything was rosy and nice.","Interestingly enough, before becoming a Baha'i, I was actually an anti-theist. Not only was I more or less oppositional to the notion of there being a God, I also was (quite an order of magnitude more) oppositional to the phenomenon of religion. I grew up in the Southern United States where religion is largely used as a weapon against scientific investigation and a solace only for the ignorant and the irretrievably superstitious. I bought into the notion that Muslims, Christians, and Jews all believed in the same God but had different books and different rules and practices which corresponded to those books but ultimately since they all believe that the other two are hell-bound, their God could not possibly be anything but vindictive and petulant and nasty.   When I encountered the Baha'i Faith, I was struck by the fact even way back in 1844, both the Bab and Baha'u'llah preached and established that which is objectively true, including that  emancipation of women, the elimination of all prejudices, the universal education of all children, and the unity of all mankind were and are moral truths and imperatives which ring true even to this day. Baha'u'llah taught me that God sent forth all major religions in an effort to educate mankind and to raise him up as a wonder of creation, and that humanity was a single family with no essential divisions.  Because of His Writings, I feel considerably closer to Christianity and to Jesus than I ever did when I was raised as a Christian. These principles are the exponents of justice and ring as true to both the mind and the soul.  My conclusion before becoming a Baha'i was that only three things could be possible: 1) Baha'u'llah was a liar. 2) Baha'u'llah was not a liar, but a certifiably insane person. 3) Baha'u'llah is who he says he is. A hallmark of religion is that it is the single existing benchmark which universally offers human beings better reasons to act in someone else's best interest than their own. The centerpiece thereof is loving service unto others, and the prophets are exemplars of that impulse to serve. Baha'u'llah, a Persian nobleman who was born into a life of hereditary luxury, had no rational reason or motivation to sacrifice everything which was his birthright for five decades of imprisonment, torture, exile, abasement, and solitude. Any liar would have sold himself out under the pressure of being potentially executed for imitating a prophet and taken that which was offered to Baha'u'llah, which was that if he recanted his faith in the Bab as the Qa'im, they would let him live. The ""he's an insane person"" argument might give insights as to why he would have stared death in the face and refused to balk, but why then would his family and descendants believe in His Cause and His Message? What motivation do they have? Isn't is absurd to assume that they \*all\* must be insane? After all, they dealt with imprisonment and torture and exile right alongside him, and never once did even the covenant-breakers claim that they disbelieved in Baha'u'llah. Neither of those presumptions are sufficient in addressing the wondrous mystery that is the nature of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, and thus I chose to see the Truth for what it was, the Truth. I figured that living my life as a Baha'i could bring me no harm or hardship, and there was no reason not to, and it was the best decision I have ever made.",comment_1,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

If the purpose of this subreddit is atheist issues in an environment supportive to women's views in addition to men's, then wouldn't any atheist issue qualify?  Conversely, if we are only talking about gender issues aren't we feeding the general misogynistic trend in the atheist community by ghettoizing these threads away from the larger group?","I'll try to organize my thoughts the best way I can without bloviating.  I started the subreddit because there was a need.  I'm sure if I didn't start it someone else would have.  This goes into the issue of relevance.  There are topics that women and other minorities will relate to like how public policy that has a basis in religion may impact women.  While I could post it in r/atheism, a lot of times, it gets washed out by other posts.  But, a politician who says atheists should be deported may be of interest to the broader community.    Women are an untapped minority in the atheist community.  Having this subreddit encourages women to come out.  Plus, on r/atheism, you can't really post a link to an atheist woman without a ""nice tits"" comment. I know it's meant as something  funny, but it cheapens what was actually said.  I do encourage people to be a part of r/atheism.  There are some interesting posts in between the memes and the rage comments.  But, it's nice for women to have an escape. And, I've gotten comments from some men that say they prefer this subreddit or black atheism because the discussions are more intellectual.","I agree with everything you said, but was wondering if you were ok with us posting non-gender specific atheist topics.

What are your plans going forward?  We asked pastors across Canada and got a wide variety of answers!  **During the Pandemic**  Of the forty-five pastors who responded to the survey, nine indicated that during the pandemic, their congregations have been primarily closed and although their members are attending online services and activities, they have not been hosting their own regular online events. Three more congregations have been mostly closed but have hosted occasional online gatherings. A further eleven have oscillated between gathering in-person when possible and being closed when necessary.  For congregations that have been hosting their own online services, nine have switched between regular online gatherings when necessary and in-person meetings when possible. Thirteen of our congregations have primarily moved to hosting regular services online without meeting in-person with any regularity. Of these, eight have primarily consisted of local members, and five have seen their online events emerge as a hub for other congregations.  **Plans Going Forward**  There are also a wide variety of plans going forward. In many cases, the answers given remain tentative. Three congregations that haven‚Äôt been meeting indicated that they do not yet have plans to begin meeting in-person or online. Sixteen have either resumed in-person activities or intend to do so and have no plans to host online activities. Seven congregations foresee a mixture: some activities will be in-person, others will be online.  Seven more plan on offering hybrid activities, where people meeting in-person can interact with those joining online. At least three plan to continue congregational alliances, participating in online activities hosted by partner congregations. As many as nine congregations say they do not yet have any plans to meet in-person.  **A Wonderful Time to Meet and Share Ideas**  Re-opening plans will be the topic of the breakout rooms in this Saturday‚Äôs All Voices Zoom Conference.

I got thinking of Cain again because I learned it's a Mormon belief that Cain exists today as bigfoot. I'm not here to ask if Cain is bigfoot, but I remembered it being said Cain was made immortal by God (the image of him walking around today struck me as noteworthy) and that anyone who strikes at him would be struck sevenfold in return, as if protected like an arhat. Many would at first think his status as murderer (partially justified though) would deter the role/title, but more than half of the manifestations written in Baha'i scripture could relate (e.g. Moses killing a slave). Based on an understanding of it, could one say the title is applicable to Cain?","Cain isn't a Manifestation -- he's more or less a kind of antithesis of the Manifestation, a sort of 'antichrist' or 'covenant breaker' type figure.

I did a stool analysis and there was Entamoeba Histolytica with Undigested food. so I ate very little, had malabsorption and diarrhea.  I went to an endocrine doctor and he measured my wingspan and said that my vertical height is 10 cm shorter than it should be for the right proportions.  I did an X-ray on my knees and all my growth plates have fused which means that I won't grow taller anymore. I wasn't into sports or literally, any physical activity. I was very very inactive through my teenage years, stayed at home playing video games all day.  So I was sitting on my chair all the time not doing any physical activity although I knew I was the shortest among my friends, I didn't care back then and now, I regret not doing stretching exercises or trying to eat more. I truly think I stunted my growth with my horrible lifestyle, I am way shorter than my dad.  I have been very depressed the past two years because of this.  Can you please pray that God helps me get my lost height? Can God even grant such prayer after all my growth plates have fused? I only want an inch or two.  Can God increase my height?","Did the doctor offer any suggestions? I pray that God will do what is best for you. You have been through such a hard time. I pray that, if increased height really isn't in the future, He gives you peace and assurance that He has great plans for you.","Hey brother why is it exactly that you‚Äôre worried about height?  I want to share with you something that might blow your mind, and no I am not exaggerating when I say this.  I am tall (6‚Äô3), and so I have spent most my life being taller than most people.  That being said, I have always noticed something- that I am shocked when some people tell me how short they really are (like the actual measurement).  Because what I have realized is that ‚Äútallness‚Äù to me, is directly related to confidence.  It‚Äôs less about physical height than it is about how you present yourself.  A 5‚Äô3 guy could seem ‚Äútaller‚Äù to me than a 6‚Äô0 guy if he was confident in himself, assertive, and had good posture.  And I would actually mistake these people as ‚Äútaller‚Äù than they actually were, all throughout my life.  I‚Äôm not just making this up.  What I realized over time is that the biggest factor of being tall is actually a psychological one; how someone presents themselves, how confident they are, and how much ‚Äúsocial space‚Äù they take up.  As for getting girls, there will always be girls shorter than you, so you got nothing to worry about there.  What makes a man has nothing to do with how physically tall he is, and I hope my anecdote can prove that to you, about how many times I thought short guys were way taller than they actually were.  I hope that helps, but it seems like what you really need is some confidence.  I struggled all my life with body dysmorphia and horrible acne, and I always thought that if I just didn‚Äôt have acne or didn‚Äôt have such an asymmetrical face that I could finally be confident, but that‚Äôs just not true.  We tend to find physical flaws in ourselves to blame for our lack of confidence when we are afraid to confront the deeper issues.

We want to know what we don't know, and the species, in this, is comparable to a small child.  Now, for example, say a child has never been taught what a cloud is, and how they come to be. That child may fabricate the idea that the clouds are animals. Silly as it sounds, this idea is completely justified, as the child is under the following conditions: * No knowledge about clouds  * Little knowledge about animals.  * Nothing in his knowledge directly contradicts the clouds being animals.  You see the child has assumed this out of thin air, but in his current knowledge set, it's a fair assumption. He wanted to know, he couldn't find out, so he built his own completely reasonable idea, at least in his current knowledge set.  How is this comparable to the Human race? Well. Some thousands of years ago, around the dawn of religion, is also when humans began to question. To question how they came to be, how the animals, world, sun and stars came to be.  Without anything at all near modern technology, they had to; similarly to the child, assume/fabricate a theory based on nothing. The reason they did this is that knowledge is like crack for the human race, we just can't get enough, and theories that make sense are the next best things to knowledge.  Their chosen assumption/fabrication was that everyone and everything was put here by someone of a higher power, invisible and undetectable to them. Completely fair, and logical, so long as evidence and human reason cannot disprove it.  This assumption spread into many forms over the years, was modified, and made all nice and pretty, to give people even more reason to believe it. Examples  * Christianity  * Islam  But now, we as a race have the capability, and technology, to find evidence for the truth. Yet still, so many people believe in  what we assumed. Even when the hard evidence directly contradicts it.  This is like the child growing up, being taught and shown about evaporation, condensation and precipitation, and still believing the clouds are animals. We need to continue following our human nature and dump what we made up.  That pretty much sums it up. If they say ""God is real we didn't make it up"" Use these points and more to bring them round  * God created light, and then the sun and stars..... o.O?  * If god knows what's going to happen, why does he get so pissed when everything happens? That would just make him an asshole, and if so, why are you worshipping an asshole?  * If worshipping anything else is a sin, and he killed a bunch of people for being rude to their dad, why doesn't he drown all the Islamic people?  * God thought the world was flat until we knew it wasn't..... what!?

It's delusion because self is a delusion.   Enlightened ones can just see unpleasant feelings as unpleasant feelings, no need for aversion to arise.   Unenlightened people see unpleasant feelings as MY unpleasant feelings, so there arises aversion, dislike, hate, anger towards the object which comes into contact.  In terms of addict recovery, the unpleasant feelings arises due to withdrawal effect, there can be aversion or hate towards whatever that is preventing one from indulging in the addiction.","Anger. Hatred. Jealousy. You can think of it as postive, negative and neutral. Ego is constantly trying to confirm itself. That's klesha.

For example, most people people feel desire for the opposite sex, aversion toward their own sex, and ignore old people as having no value to their self definition.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/RadicalChristianity.jsonl,RadicalChristianity.jsonl,5oqj50,Toward Another Reading of Romans 13,"Hi  So it's no secret that Romans 13 or at least its traditional interpretation has always been a bit of a thorn in the side of those who believe Christ and his movement were revolutionary. That said, many of the ways I've seen people deal with this passage on this sub have been at best unsatisfactory, if I may say so.   There have been some who will reject this passage and perhaps reject Paul's writings as a whole because of the traditional reading's obviously harmful political implications. On the one hand such a reaction is understandable, but on the other hand it is inconsistent with a Christian leftist doctrine. We cannot oppose our views to the views espoused in some of the founding texts of Christianity while simultaneously claiming that Christianity is revolutionary. Perhaps we could claim that Paul betrays Christ's message, but I am not ready to make such a claim until we have arrived at an interpretation of Paul's writings that seems beyond a reasonable doubt to remain faithful to what Paul meant. At that point we may determine whether we accept or reject his message.  There are also those who will accept the traditional reading in part, but suggest that this passage calls Christians to resist authority in more passive and likely non-violent ways. But this reading does not make sense with the text itself. Even if we were to accept that non-violent obedience to authority could somehow lead to political change (which is a position I have trouble accepting), Paul does not say ""Earthly authorities are wrong, but obey them anyways and in doing so resist them.""  Paul says   &gt;Therefore, whoever resists authority opposes what God has appointed, and those who oppose it will bring judgment upon themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear to good conduct, but to evil. Do you wish to have no fear of authority? Then do what is good and you will receive approval from it, for it is a servant of God for your good.  To say that this passage is simply placing limits on disobedience to authority does not make sense to me either.  Both of these positions, however, implicitly accept partly, or as a whole, the traditional interpretation of this passage. The reason why we must reject this interpretation and arrive at a new one is not solely because of its political implications, but because it is itself incoherent. We are not opposing ourselves to Christ or even Paul in doing so, but rather searching for a more coherent way to understand this passage.  The idea that Paul, a follower of Christ, who was crucified at the hands of both Roman and Jewish authorities would not only affirm their legitimacy, but suggest that they could only do good is absurd. Paul worships a man who was killed at the hands of the imperial state. He believes the Romans executed the Son of God, so for him to say ""Roman authorities do not punish good people, only evil. They are servants of God"" would be an almost comical oversight on his part. This reading would also directly contradict Jesus who said (albeit in a different context) ""'No one can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other.'""  I believe that to understand what Paul may mean here, we should examine Jesus's crucifixion and what the act itself would mean to a follower of Christ. Jesus's crucifixion was the negation of the earthly law and authority. Not only does the fact that the Son of God was brutally murdered at the hands of the State destroy all legitimacy of Roman law, but the fact that Christ offers salvation to those who share in his faith in God destroys any means for the Romans or any other earthly authorities to rule through fear. Those who are saved in Christ have next to nothing to fear in earthly authority as they are already saved.  Perhaps this is what Paul means in this passage. Not only is there no escaping God's ultimate authority, but those on earth who claim authority but directly contradict the word of God, themselves have no authority. So then when Paul says ""All authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God,"" he is not saying if someone appears to have authority on earth, God must have appointed him, but rather that those who claim authority but contradict the word of God are themselves powerless.  In this sense, this passage takes on an almost satirical character that certainly fits with what we know of Paul (I remember in Bernard Brandon Scott's The Real Paul, he noted that Paul appropriated a lot of the language from Roman propaganda and changed it to fit a Christian message in a way that seems almost analogous to something like detournement). That is, perhaps a loyal Roman citizen would object that ""Christians have no respect for authority"" to which Paul responds ""Actually we respect the only authority that matters.""  There are admittedly some difficulties with this interpretation such as the portion with the tax collectors afterward. At the moment I have no answer to this next portion of the passage that is entirely satisfactory (perhaps he is saying we must do right when possible by those who are merely servants of the government because they are only doing their jobs and God calls us to be kind to them. This reading may fit in to the sort of satirical character that I mentioned above. It would be somewhat redundant to say ""we pay our taxes because we respect Roman authority"" so perhaps he is saying yes we pay the tax collector, but for different reasons. This is still a bit clumsy though so I would be open to reading this section differently), but what is important, in my opinion, is not that we accept this interpretation so much as that we wholly reject the old interpretation. It simply does not make sense. If you have a better reading I would be happy to hear it.",Did you go through [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalChristianity/comments/1ce3hr/because_of_jesuss_teachings_today_i_refused_to/) and the linked article?,"No actually.

Lewis' thoughts on the origins of morality? He says morality is like a straight line that we can all perceive, and immorality is a crooked line. The only way we can tell if something is crooked is by comparing it to something straight.   This straight line is a sense of morality that humans are in a predisposition to feel and understand regardless of upbringing.   This line comes from a superior being that is above us all, who has power to name it as such.","C.S. Lewis was appealing to the idea of [Natural Law Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law), which is a tied to the works of [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) (Aquinas being a famous Catholic monk of the Middle Ages). The Natural Law is itself tied to the works of Plato and and Aristotle (i.e. pre-Christian philosophers), whom proposed that the idea true perfection exists... somewhere, somehow.  This standard of perfection is how our minds judge the world. To Aristotle, to measure anything against an imperfect standard is to not measure anything at all... this is akin to the idea of a ruler (i.e. measuring stick) with irregular markings. If an inch isn't drawn correctly on a ruler, then everything you measure with that ruler will be meaningless.  C.S. Lewis is appealing to this idea, the idea that a true standard of morality must exist... and if it doesn't, the whole of reality is meaningless... it is gibberish with no true value... The perfection described by Aristotle and Plato is same perfection of God, the creator (according to ancient monks like Aquinas and Saint Augustine). If a perfect creator doesn't exist, according to this line of thought, then the whole world is a subjective mess... A true right vs wrong and a true perfection vs imperfection, give everything value and meaning... the fact that people all around the world agree (i.e. the vast majority ) that immoral behavior and moral behavior is real, is the evidence that morality itself is real... Thinkers all around the world (e.g. Confucius in China and Christ in Rome came up with the Golden Rule, ""do onto others as you would want done unto yourself"").  &amp;#x200B;  Therefore, the immorality we see is real, but it is the result of human freewill. Humans have freewill so that they can honor and recognize the value of perfection present to their minds... the perfection of God... (i.e. to express the goodwill that they feel in their hearts or rejoice in the results of their good actions) ...or they have the freewill to ignore their own good nature and do bad deeds. Such a being, which knows of perfection but chooses immorality, is evil. This is why sin is our fault, we know what is right, but we choose to disobey knowing that such sin is wrong... the perfection of God is in our hearts, because we were made in his image... and we feel it when we honor or disgrace that perfection.","Confucius say, man who drop watch in toilet have shitty time. ***** ^(""Just a bot trying to brighten up someone's day with a laugh. | Message me if you have one you want to add."")",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.2422314711

What about you guys?","It is very important to know the context of what he meant by ""ending"". It is the ending of suffering, the work that has been done is done, the end of burdens. A path that does not lead to woeful realms anymore, headed to the end of kamma, freedom from samsara.   That kind of ending.   In one sense there is nothing natural about the path of Buddhism relative to the flow of samsara. It is a path and practice goes against the grain of the world.   And in another sense, the dhamma is natural because it is the truth of existence. Anicca, anatta, dukkha.   The dhamma is hard to see, difficult to discover on our own. Samsara, the sensual realm is mara's camp, a natural design to easily trap most beings in this mass of suffering.  Discern these things. Buddhism is natural in one context, unnatural in another context. Force is blameless in certain context, and harmful in other context.   Like how the striving and effort to maintain precepts for the path is a forced effort in early stages of the practice. And fruits and wisdom born from such practice may results in effortless expressions of precepts at higher attainments. But it starts from great effort and striving and enduring pressures that don't feel ""natural"" in the beginning. Painful even.   Speak with the right context and discernment on dhamma. Casual, heedless words, ideas of wrong view bring harm to yourself and others.","I think that in any spiritual practice there is a dialog between effort and effortlessness.  I also think that in the West we use the word ""natural"" in a very unnatural way.  Practice is natural, and work is natural.  Just watch any squirrel running up and down a tree.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,270neu,Moral Order in a Secular Societies,"I am agnostic, and a scientist. I do not believe we can prove the existence of the supernatural, so I am one who lives in my own world without them. I do not follow any religion because I do not believe the claims religions make, because they point to supernatural causes when I believe in natural causes. Religion, however, has been known for establishing a moral base. Self-restraint is a common theme across religions that seek to establish such a moral base. I am in my early 20s, so I interact often enough with the younger generation to know what they value. I see that many people younger than and around my age (and today's society in general) often lack self-restraint. I think this lack of self- restraint is what ultimately leads to occurrences such as that involving Elliot Rodger.  Young generations are becoming much more secular. This is in part because, generally, science is taught in schools and religion is not (of course there are exceptions). Both are normally not taught together because of issues with how literal one should interpret scriptures (although there is middle ground such as evolutionary creationists/theistic evolutionists but that's not the topic). Therefore, much of the young generation does not adopt religious beliefs, even though a good number may practice the religion (there is a difference between believing and going through the motions).  In the past and even now, we have found and find moral order from religion. Religion dictates self-restraint among other things, which in effect is a battle against ""moral entropy"" (it takes less energy to do what you want vs. doing what you should do, especially when the two don't coincide). I would LIKE to argue that religion is not the sole source of moral order, but I have not found any structured way in a secular society. Such a structure would eliminate religion as the sole source of moral order.  As a reminder, I'd like to say that the topic is about establishing morals in a society without religion, and not so much about Elliot Rodger, science vs. religion, whether religion should be taught in schools, etc. I'm interested in whatever thoughts people might have on this topic.","From an ethical point of view, there are basically three aspects that need to be answered:   1. What motivates us to be moral without an ultimate judge?  2. What is moral behavior without a law giver?  3. What grounds moral realism, ie. our impression that moral laws are universal and true?  Here's an answer from social psychology.  First, people younger than 21 are not good examples of self-constraint. They frontal lobes are still developing, and these frontal lobes are associated with inhibition which is needed for self-constraint.  Second, even adults only have limited resources when it comes to willpower. Say, you want to keep a diet. All day at work, your boss acted like a total jerk and you needed quite a lot of self-restrain to not call him names. Chances are, you'll lack the willpower to keep your diet in the evening. This has been called [ego depletion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion).  Most moral behavior, however, probably doesn't only come from willpower but from something within each of us that makes us want to be rational and moral. This has been [demonstrated by experiments of Dan Ariely](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2RKQkAoY3k&amp;feature=kp) who gave students the opportunity to cheat and the opportunity to destroy the evidence of their behavior. Interestingly, almost nobody was not cheating. What's more: Almost nobody was cheating in a big way, although they could. Almost all people cheated but only a little.  Ariely thinks this is due to our desire to appear rational and moral, which may be an evolved trait. The best way to fake being honest is by honestly thinking you do not cheat. Something like like could also explain [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance).  His experiments also demonstrate some influences on moral behavior. For instance, you can reduce cheating in these task by letting students write down the Ten Commandments. The existence of a reminder is sufficient, because no student can remember the Ten Commandments correctly. This is confirmed by making students ""remember"" their university's code of conduct, although their university has no code of conduct. Cheating still goes down to almost zero, IIRC.  This points to an answer to (1): We are inherently motivated to be good people. The problem is that we disagree largely on what is means to be good people.  From social psychology, we can also learn what makes people immoral. Interestingly, one of the most influential sources for immoral behavior is our tendency to moralize. This is because we intuitively think it's necessary to punish perceived violation of morality, or to defend what we consider moral. Both are perfect reasons to act immoral, and start burning witches, just to name one example.  This insight justifies a restriction on intuitive morality.  Finally, do we need a ground for moral objectivity and therefore God? Strictly speaking, God doesn't help much, due to the [Euthyphro dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma). Also, certain aspect of morality seem to be sufficiently ""real"", namely our common desire to avoid harm, and the logical implication of impartiality for moral rules.","Maybe we could restate Mavnorman's three questions and replace the word ""moral"" with ""successful"" like this:  1) What motivates us to be successful, if no authority figure defines success for us?  2) What is successful behavior, if no authority figure tells me what successful behavior is?  3) What basis do we have for our belief that there are foolproof tactics that guarantee success?  That first question is key, because we all want to know how to define success. Moral realists are basically saying that without God, there can be no definition of success. Thus, we can neveer really be successful without God.  On the other hand, I claim there's a different definition of success out there. This alternative definition is something all people understand subconsciously and pursue with all their efforts, even if they vehemently reject this definition of success in their conscious minds. It's our evolved survival instinct. Success means survival, but it's not just individual, short-term survival. It's species survival indefinitely into the future.",comment_2,Provides clarifying comments,,,,,,No,0.016038741

[chapters] 10-12 are really only one vision: ch. [chapter] 10 is the prologue; ch. 11, the vision and its interpretation; and ch. 12, the epilogue.  Its somewhat unwieldy length doubtless suggested the division into three parts, but the division is artificial, for there is no real break in the sense after either 10:21 or 11:45.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;The vision is dated, but again the date is merely part of the framework, intended to connect it with the other chapters, but having no significance for the material here presented.  It differs from those in chs. 7-8 in that any direct description is missing.  We gather that it was an astounding visual perception of a great warfare in heavenly places, and from the interpretation we learn that it was revealed to the seer that struggles among the nations here on earth are but the counterpart of struggles among their angelic patrons in the heavens, events here being determined by the pattern of events above.  The details of this vision, however, are not given.  After spiritual preparation accompanied by ascetic practices, the seer has a second vision in which an angel expounds the meaning of the things he has seen and tells of things which are to be.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶ Certain relevant portions of the history of the Diadochi are given in order to lead up to Antiochus Epiphanes.  His reign and his relations with the Jews are then dealt with in more detail than in the earlier chapters.  The connection of all this with the doings of the celestial powers is brought out, to prepare for the announcement that the climax is at hand, when the kingdoms of this world will be brought to an end by the advent of the kingdom of God, the kingdom which is eternal and so is beyond history.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 499)   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;‚ÄúThis last apocalypse is also the longest and the most elaborate in the book.  After a lengthy introduction that gives the setting of the revelation (10:1-11-1), and unnamed angel offers Daniel a brief account of the history of the Persian Empire and of Alexander the Great‚Ä¶ and then a very long account of the history of the Seleucid dynasty, which becomes more and more detailed as the writer approaches his own times, the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (11:5-45).  The apocalypse ends with poetic solemnity (12:1-3) and the customary warning to keep the revelation a secret (12:4).  What follows (12:5-13) are later additions.  This apocalypse has the usual purpose of guaranteeing the truth of the prediction of ultimate salvation by recounting in the form of prophecies what are actually past events.  The author‚Äôs style is considerably different from the style in the other apocalypses in Dan [Daniel], which would seem to indicate a distinct author for this section.  The Hebrew of this apocalypse is quite poor, and there are good grounds for thinking that it is based on an Aram [Aramaic] original.  The author must have composed his apocalypse before the campaign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in the east in the summer of 165, for instead of predicting this, he foretold a successful campaign of the Syrian king in Egypt for this year ‚Äì a campaign that never actually took place.‚Äù (Louis F. Hartman, 1990, p. 418)   &amp;nbsp;    -1. In **year three to KhORehSh** [Cyrus], **king** [of] **PahRah√á** [Persia],      word was revealed to DahNeeYay-‚ÄôL, that is called his name BayLTShah‚Äô-TsahR [Belteshazzar],    and **true the word**,    **and army great**,    and understanding [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the word, and **understanding to him** in an apparition [◊ë◊û◊®◊ê◊î, *BahMahR‚ÄôeH*].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúThe date is given as the **third year of Cyrus**, i.e. [""in other words""], the third year after he took Babylon, and so 536/535 B.C.  However, since the writer calculates a reign of Darius the Mede between Belshazzar son of Nabonidus and Cyrus we cannot say what date he would have regarded as the third of Cyrus.  Vs. [verse] 1 is by the redactor, for Daniel begins to speak in the first person in vs. 2.  This is the latest date the writer gives in connection with Daniel‚Äôs life.  Assuming him to have been a youth of sixteen when brought into captivity in 605 B.C., he would now, on our reckoning, be a man of eighty-six.  Neither the writer nor his audience, however, would ever have made such a calculation or been interested in the matter‚Ä¶ The verse implies that Daniel had not returned to Palestine with the exiles who went back home, for here in the **third year of Cyrus** he is still in Mesopotamia.   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;Cyrus is here called **king of Persia**.  This may be merely a statement of fact, for he was king of Persia, but if it is meant as an official title it is an anachronism in the mouth of Daniel.  The title **king of Persia** was Hellenistic usage and not the usage of the Achaemenid kings at his time‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶‚Äú**The word was true, and it was a great conflict**: Lit. [literally], ‚Äòand the word is truth and a great host.‚Äô  This phrase has been translated in many ways‚Ä¶  If we refer it to the context of the vision it would seem to be concerned with the great warfare in heaven whose pattern is reproduced in conflicts on earth.  Since the writer is interested in the last days, this is the most likely interpretation, for the **great conflict** is characteristic of the last days (Matt. [Matthew] 24:6).   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;‚Äú**He Understood**: The verbal form here is peculiar‚Ä¶‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 500-501)   &amp;nbsp;    -2. ‚ÄúIn days the those, I, DahNeeYay‚ÄôL, was **mourning** [◊û◊™◊ê◊ë◊ú, *MeeTh‚ÄôahBayL*] **three weeks** [of] days.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**Mourning**: Earlier expositors discussed whether this was mourning for the sins of the people as in 9:5‚Ä¶ or mourning because of the dreadful things that were going to happen.  Mourning, however, is a synonym for fasting (Matt. 9:14-15) and here refers to the ascetic practices of vs. 3, which in vs. 12 are called a ‚Äòhumbling.‚Äô  The writer has in mind much the same spiritual preparation as was mentioned in 9:3‚Ä¶     &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**Three weeks**: Lit., ‚Äòthree weeks days.‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p.

Hartman, 1990, p. 418)   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;‚ÄúDaniel was accustomed to use meat and wine, but for these three weeks of special abstinence he gave them up.  There is no need, however, to labor this as inconsistent with 1:8 ff. [and following], where it is said that Daniel and his friends ate only vegetable food at the court so as to avoid risk of possible defilement from ritually unclean meat.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 501)   &amp;nbsp;    -4. ‚ÄúAnd in **day twenty and four** to **month the first**,    and I was upon hand [of] the river, the great; **it is HeeDahQehL**.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúThat date and place of the vision are given with such exactitude is part of the convention of apocalyptic ‚Ä¶ The **first month** would be that which is called ‚ÄòAbib‚Äô in Deut.

If **the twenty-fourth day** is supposed to mark the end of the seer‚Äôs fast, then his period of fasting would have included the Passover festival on the fourteenth, that of Unleavened Bread from the fifteenth to the twenty-first, and so the days when according to Deut. 16:3 the ‚Äòbread of affliction‚Äô should be eaten‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;**That is, the Tigris**: Lit., **which is Hiddekel** (cf. [compare with] Gen. [Genesis] 2:14).  This seems to be an early gloss.

The description given here seems to transcend that given of Gabriel in the earlier chapters, and his appearance had a graver effect on the seer than that of Gabriel had, which suggests some supernatural being superior to Gabriel and Michael and carefully distinguished by the writer from them‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;The description of him has many reminiscences of the figures in Ezek. [Ezekiel] 1; 9-10.  His clothing resembles that of a high priest (Lev. [Leviticus] 6:10‚Ä¶), which apparently means that he is a celestial high priest (see Rev. [Revelation] 1:13; 15:6).  The celestial visitant in Ezek. 9:2-3‚Ä¶ wore fine linen‚Ä¶ **Around his waist was a girdle of gold**‚Ä¶ The angel in Rev. 1:13 has such a girdle.  **Gold of Uphaz**: The phrase occurs in Jer.

Rev. 1:15; 2:18).  *Margeloth* means the place where the feet stand and not the **legs**, but it must have been transferred in meaning to the body, for in Rev. 1:15, which is based on this passage, we have ŒøŒπ œÄŒøŒ¥ŒµœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ [*oi podes autou*, ‚Äúthe feet of him‚Äù].

At first the angel‚Äôs speech seemed not articulate but a rolling, reverberating sound, and only as the seer became used to it did he distinguish words.  *HƒÅm√¥n* is used of any deep sound, of the noise of the sea (Isa. 60:5‚Ä¶), or heavy rain (I Kings 18:41), or the rumbling of the bowels (Isa. 63:15), or chariots (Jer. 47:3), of the deep murmur of a crowded city (Job 39:7‚Ä¶), or the rumbling of a host of moving cattle (Jer. 49:32).  Rev. 1:15 takes it to mean the noise of waters‚Ä¶‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 503)     &amp;nbsp;      -7. ‚ÄúAnd I saw, I, DahNeeYay-‚ÄôL, alone, [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the sight;    and the men that were with me did not see [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the sight,    but quaking [◊ó◊®◊ì◊î, *HahRahDaH*] great fell upon them,    and they fled [◊ï◊ô◊ë◊®◊õ◊ï, *VahYeeBReHOo*] in[to] hiding [◊ë◊î◊ó◊ë◊ê, *BeHayHahBay‚Äô*].   &amp;nbsp;    -8.

[Samuel] 28:20, where King Saul is similarly affected by the appearance of Samuel‚Äôs ghost, though there it is said expressly that his previous fasting was partly responsible for his weakness.  **My comeliness was turned in me into corruption**: In Hab. [Habakkuk] 3:16 there is a similar description of the physical effects of the coming of a divine revelation‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;‚Ä¶*H√¥dh* is **comeliness**, ‚Äòsplendor,‚Äô but is not used elsewhere of the countenance.  In 5:9 Belshazzar‚Äôs ‚Äòsplendor,‚Äô i.e., his *z»ãw*, brightness of countenance, was changed by his distress of mind as Daniel‚Äôs was by similar distress in 7:28, and it is possible that this *h√¥dh* is merely a translation of an Aramaic *z»ãw*.  **Was fearfully changed**: Lit., **was turned in me into corruption**.  **Corruption** is used abstractly as in Ezek. 21:31; II Chr. [Chronicles] 20:23.  The root is that ‚Äòmarred‚Äô used in Isa. 52:14, ‚Äòhis visage was marred more than any man.‚Äô  As in 7:28, it refers to the sudden pallor induced by fear, which robs the countenance of its accustomed brightness.   **Retained no strength**: A late idiom found in Daniel and Chronicles.  It occurs again in vs. 16, 11:6.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 504)   &amp;nbsp;     -9. ‚ÄúAnd I heard [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] voice of his words,    and as I heard [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] voice of his words,    and I was ***asleep*** [◊†◊®◊ì◊ù, *NeeRDahM*] upon my face,    and my face landward.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúIn vs. 6 the angelic voice was just a great rumbling sound, but now the seer distinguishes individual sounds and recognizes that they make up articulate speech, but when he realizes that these words are being spoken to him he is further overcome and falls into a swoon.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶ *RƒÅdham* is to lie **in a deep sleep**, ‚Äòto be stunned,‚Äô ‚Äòto be stupefied.‚Äô  So in 8:18, the seer became unconscious when the angel spoke to him (cf. Rev. 1:17; Saul‚Äôs falling to the ground in Acts 9:4; and the experience of the prophet in Ezek. 1:28; 2:1; Enoch 14:24).‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 504)   &amp;nbsp;    -10. ‚ÄúAnd behold, a hand touched me, and staggered me [◊ï◊™◊†◊ô◊¢◊†◊ô, *VahThNeeY`ayNeeY*] upon my knees and palms [of] my hands.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúThe seer is restored by a touch of the angel‚Ä¶ In 8:18 Gabriel had to touch him to set him upright, and in 9:21, touched him to reassure him before giving him the message.  In II Esdras 5:15 the angel held the seer, comforted him, and set him on his feet.  Here, however, the angel only half raises him, ‚Äòand he caused me to shake upon my knees and the palms of my hands‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 504-505)   &amp;nbsp;    -11. ‚ÄúAnd he said unto me,    ‚ÄòDahNeeYay-‚ÄôL, man beloved,    understand in words that I word unto you,    and **stand upon your stands**,    for now [◊¢◊™◊î, *`ahThaH*] I am sent forth unto you.‚Äô   &amp;nbsp;    And in his words with me, [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the word the this, I stood **trembling** [◊û◊®◊¢◊ô◊ì, *MahR`eeD*].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**Stand upright**: Lit., ‚Äòstand upon thy standing‚Äô (See 8:18; also Ezek. 2:1, where the prophet is raised and set upon his feet to hear the message‚Ä¶ **Trembling**: This is not the word used in vs. 7  [◊ó◊®◊ì◊î, *HahRDaH*, ‚Äúquaking‚Äù], but it occurs in Ezra 10:9‚Ä¶‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 505)   &amp;nbsp;    -12. ‚ÄúAnd he said unto me,    ‚ÄòDo not fear [◊™◊ô◊®◊ê, TheeYRah‚Äô], DahNeeYay-‚ÄôL,    for from the day the first that you **gave** [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] your heart to understand and to **be humble** [◊ï◊ú◊î◊™◊¢◊†◊ï◊™, *OoLeHeeTh`ahNOTh*] before your Gods,    were heard your words,    and I came in your words.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúSo in Luke 1:11 ff. the angel was sent in response to Zechariah‚Äôs prayer.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;**To set the mind** is a late idiom found elsewhere in the O.T. [Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible] only in Ecclesiastes and Chronicles.  A somewhat different idiom to express the same thing is used in 1:8, and it seems very likely that both translate the Aramaic ◊©◊ï◊ù ◊ë◊ú [*SOoM BahL*] with an infinitive which we have in 6:14 (M.T. [Masoretic Text, the authorized Hebrew Bible] 6:15).  **Humbled yourself**: Undertook various forms of self-mortification during the fast (cf. Ezra 8:21).  The verb is commonly translated ‚Äòto afflict‚Äô and is used in particular for fasting as an affliction of the soul, so that it gave rise to a technical term for fasting.  As in 9:3, self-mortification was a spiritual preparation.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 505)   &amp;nbsp;    -13. ‚Äú‚ÄòAnd a prince [of] [the] kingdom [of] PahRah√á **stood to against me** twenty and one day[s], and behold, *MeeKhah-‚ÄôayL* [‚ÄúWho is Like God?‚Äù, Michael], **one** [of] **the princes, the first**, came to help me,    **and I remained** [◊†◊ï◊™◊®◊™◊ô, *NOThahRTheeY*] **there** with [◊ê◊¶◊ú, *‚ÄôehTsehL*] kings of PahRah√á.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶*Michael*‚Ä¶*he who is like God*‚Ä¶there is no archangel mentioned in the whole Scripture, but this one.  See Jude 9; Rev. xii, 7.‚Äù (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. 343)   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶ the angel explains that for twenty-one days he had been hindered from coming by the opposition of the angel patron of Persia; he had been finally able to get away only because Michael, the patron angel of the Jews, had come to his assistance.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;**Princes**: As in ‚Äòthe Prince of the host‚Äô in 8:11.  From early times in Mesopotamia each city-state, while harboring the cults for many deities, yet had its own tutelary deity who was the particular object of worship in the cult of the city-state, and who necessarily had the interests of that city-state under his or her peculiar are.  Much the same situation was found in early Egypt, and at a later date in other areas of the Near East.  With the growth of the great Empires there came to be one city deity who was in a special way the god of that empire, as Amon-Re became for Egypt with the supremacy of Thebes, Ashur for Assyria with the supremacy of its empire, and Marduk for Babylonia with the supremacy of Babylon.  In later monotheistic thought this survived in the notion that under the one Lord there were angelic patrons of the various nations to whom was committed the task of ruling various departments concerned with mundane affairs.  In this way many defects evident in the running of worldly affairs could be attributed to the limitations of angelic wisdom and not laid to the charge of the Almighty.  Under such a scheme the patron angels of the nations would be responsible for the affairs of their particular national groups.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Some see this idea already present in such passages as Isa. 24:21; Ps. [Psalms] 82, but it does not come to clear expression earlier than these last chapters of Daniel‚Ä¶ Only a little later we find it widely recognized (Ecclus. [Ecclesiasticus] 17:17; Jubilees 15:31-32; Enoch 89:59).  The usual theory was that each of the seventy nations mentioned in Gen. 10 had its patron angel who represented its interests at the heavenly court and directed its affairs on earth.  It will be remembered that Origen‚Ä¶ says some of these patron angels were converted at the sight of Jesus, which explains the rapid spread of Christianity among their national groups.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;The patron angel of Persia in the later angelology was Dubbiel.  **Withstood**: What the controversy was between this angel and Dubbiel we are not told.  ‚Ä¶Since in ch. 11 the writer gives an account of the Persian Empire and the coming to power of the Greek Empire and the relationship of the Jews thereto, it is possible that he means his audience to understand that this present angel was an angel of higher authority than the patron angles and was continually having trouble with them in the execution of his duties, since each of them was always wanting to push the interests of his nation.  Michael, the patron of the Jews, was here willing to help him because he was engaged on some matter which concerned them.  This would link the controversy in one way with the message to Daniel, since that message had to do with the bringing to an end all these national powers and the setting up of the final kingdom in which all the nations would be subject to the Jews.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;**Michael**, as we see from vs. 21; 12:1, was the patron angel of the Jews.  This is the earliest literary reference to Michael, who is here called **one of the chief princes**.  He appears as one of the four archangels in Enoch 9:1; 71:9, and as one of the seven in Enoch 20:5.  In Jude 9 he is the angel who contends with Satan, and in Rev. 12:7 he leads his forces against those of the dragon.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;**So I left him there**: The text here is difficult.  The M.T. reads ‚Äòand I was left there up against the kings of Persia.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 506-507)   &amp;nbsp;    -14. ‚Äú‚ÄòAnd I came to make you understand [◊ú◊î◊ë◊ô◊†◊ö, *LahHahBeeYNKhah*] [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] that will happen to your people in last of the days,    for another vision to days.‚Äô   &amp;nbsp;    -15. And in his wording with me like words the these,    I gave my face landward and became mute [◊ï◊†◊ê◊ú◊û◊™◊ô, *VeNeh‚ÄôehLahMTheeY*].    -16. And behold, [one] as resembles sons of ‚ÄôahDahM [""man"", Adam] touched upon my lips, and I opened my mouth, and I worded, and I said unto the stander to opposite me [◊ú◊†◊í◊ì◊ô, *LeNehGDeeY*],      &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúIn Isa. 6:7 a hot coal touches the prophet‚Äôs lips to inspire him to deliver his message.  It is curious that again the writer refuses to identify the angelic figure, using an indefinite phrase ‚Äòhe who was standing in front of me.‚Äô‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 508)      &amp;nbsp;    ‚Äú‚ÄòMy lord, in an apparition were transformed [◊†◊î◊§◊õ◊ï, *NeHehPhKhOo*] my *pangs* [◊¶◊ô◊®◊ô, *TseeYRah-eeY*] upon me,    and **I did not retain strength**.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú‚ÄòMy pangs have turned upon me.‚Äô  He is using the imagery of the pangs of childbirth (cf. I Sam.  ...).  *√á»ãr* is from the verb ‚Äòto writhe,‚Äô ‚Äòto twist,‚Äô and so is a vivid image of the distress into which the vision had cast Daniel.  In Isa. 21:3 there is a similar comparison with reference to the strange excitement of the physical body brought about by the phenomena of revelation.  **I retain not strength** is repeated from vs. 8.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 508)   &amp;nbsp;    -17. ‚Äú‚ÄòAnd how [◊ï◊î◊ô◊ö, *VeHaYKh*] is able, slave of my lord, this, to word with my lord **this**,    and I, **from now** is not **standing** in me strength,    and breath does not **remain** [◊†◊©◊ê◊®◊î, *NeeSh‚ÄôahRaH*] in me.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**This**, which the KJV [King James Version] has endeavored to keep, is a particle of emphasis, repeated here, it is true, but since it has no equivalent in English, it is best omitted from translation‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;**For now**: Lit., ‚Äòand as for me now.‚Äô  The word ◊û◊¢◊™◊î [*May`aThaH*] is normally ‚Äòfrom now on,‚Äô ‚Äòhenceforth,‚Äô so Theod. Œ±œÄŒø œÑŒø ŒΩœÖŒΩ [*apo to nun*], but that does not make much sense here‚Ä¶ Ehrlich‚Äôs suggestion that it is the argumentative ‚Äònow‚Äô avoids emendation and makes good sense.  **Remains**: Lit., ‚Äòstands‚Äô (cf. Josh. [Joshua] 2:11; and the statement about the queen of Sheba in I Kings 10:5).‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 509)   &amp;nbsp;    -18. ‚ÄúAnd he continued, and he touched in me, like appearance [of] ‚ÄôahDahM, and strengthened me [◊ï◊ô◊ó◊ñ◊ß◊†◊ô, *VahYeHahZQayNeeY*].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúEzekiel in his vision saw things having the ‚Äòappearance‚Äô of earthly things (Ezek. 1:13-14‚Ä¶).‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p.

Its formal epistolary usage had appeared in 4:1; 6:25, and the angel uses it now because it is the customary formula of greeting among men (cf. Judg. [Judges] 6:23; 19:20; Gen. 43:23; I Sam 25:6).  It is curious that the writer, having used the formula customary at the beginning of a letter, follows it by the formula used for closing a letter, **be strong and of good courage** (cf. Deut. 31:7, 23; also the ŒµœÅœÅœâœÉŒø Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÖŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒπŒΩŒµ [*erroso kai ugiaine*, ‚Äúgoodbye and be well‚Äù^2 ] of Greek writers, which appears as ŒµœÅœÅœâœÉŒ∏Œµ [*errosthe*, ‚Äúbe healthy‚Äù] in Acts 15:29; II Macc. [Maccabees] 11:21).  The M.T. has ‚Äòbe strong, yea, be strong,‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, p. VI 509)   &amp;nbsp;    -20. ‚ÄúAnd he said, ‚Äò**Do you know** [◊î◊ô◊ì◊¢◊™, *HahYahDah`Thah*] **to what** I came unto you?

This is a rhetorical question since in vs. 14 he had already told the seer why he had come‚Ä¶ If we keep the M.T. we must understand this question as intended to awaken anew the interest of the seer in the explanation now to be given.  Bentzen compares the similar rhetorical question of the elders in Rev. 7:13.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;From here on to the introductory verse of ch. 11 the text is in a tangle, and has exercised the ingenuity of various editors‚Ä¶ That the conflict with the angel of Persia is soon to be complicated by the appearance of the patron angel of Greece is clear, but the exact rendering is not sure‚Ä¶ [some] take it to mean ‚Äòas soon as I am free from the conflict with the patron of Persia, the patron of Greece will be there and will have to be resisted.‚Äô  This has in its favor the historical situation that as soon as the Persian supremacy was ended, that of Greece arose.‚Äù (Jeffery, 1956, pp. VI 509-510)   &amp;nbsp;    -21. ‚Äú‚ÄòBut I will tell to you, [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] the inscription [◊î◊®◊©◊ï◊ù, *HahRahShOoM*] in **writing true**,    and there is not one stronger [◊û◊™◊ó◊ñ◊ß, *MeeThHahZayQ*] with me upon these,    for if [◊õ◊ô ◊ê◊ù, *KeeY ‚ÄôeeM*] **MeeYKhah-‚ÄôayL, your prince**.‚Äô‚Äù   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**The book of truth**: I.e., the book of decrees, in which have been set down all the divine decrees as to events yet to happen (cf. Ps. 139:16).  These *dup≈°≈´nƒÅti*, or tablets of fate, appear early in the religious history of Mesopotamia and in later times were associated with the events of the Babylonian New Year festival.  In the Talmud [ancient Jewish commentary] (Rosh ha-Shana [‚ÄúHead of the Year‚Äù, i.e., ‚ÄúNew Year‚Äù] 16*b*) we read how on New Year‚Äôs Day the books were opened and fates recorded.  These tablets and the book are frequently mentioned in Jubilees and the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs; and in the prayer of Joseph preserved in Origen *Philocalia*‚Ä¶ we read, ‚ÄòFor I have read in the tablets of heaven all that shall befall you and your sons.‚Äô   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;**Michael** is **your prince** because he is the patron angel of the Jewish nation (cf. vs. 13; 12:1).  It is for this reason that in Jude 9 he disputes with the devil over the body of Moses, which the devil was claiming on the ground that he had killed an Egyptian and was a murderer.  In Assumption of Moses‚Ä¶ he appears as the angel who at the end of the world avenges Israel on their enemies.  In Enoch 20:5 he is one of the archangels who is set over the ‚Äòbest of mankind,‚Äô i.e., the Jews.  That Israel had a special guardian angel was deduced from such passages as Exod.

Since the First Crusade doesn't seem a sufficient ground to suggest that killing really ought to be licit, I see no reason to accept that as a legitimate theological development, but rather a pretty clear theological mistake. Also, since this sort of doctrine has generally been revoked, so far as I'm aware, the onus really lies with the person suggesting these doctrines to give reason why we should consider them.  However, my rejection of this particular case is further compounded in that I would reject the underlying assumptions regarding the two swords doctrine and the medieval filial relationship between Christ, as the king of kings, and the Christians as his subjects (in a quasi-feudal sense), that the crusades depended upon.

My wife and I are looking for a new church, and PCUSA is one I'm curious about.  What are the differences?  What is the PCUSA like?  Thanks!",Obviously you seem to know pcusa is typically more liberal theologically than the pca. We've found it really depends on the specific church. In our area we have two pcusa churches one very liberal the other mildly conservative. And their styles differ quite a bit too. Heck the first and second service of one church are hardly same.,"Differences between PC(USA) and PCA:  - The PC(USA) ordains women and values the leadership of women. This is the biggest, most direct difference. There are women pastors in PC(USA) congregations, and the session of a Presbyterian Church must include women as well. So called ""complementarianism"" does not typically fly in a PC(USA) church.  - Unlike the PCA; The PC(USA) is deeply divided on the issue of homosexuality. In recent years this has clearly manifests itself in church-wide debates about the ordination of non-celibate gays and lesbians and gay marriage. Currently, the PC(USA) leaves it up to local congregations and presbyteries to decided whether or not to ordain homosexuals, and out of the 200 or so pastor ordinations that have taken place since that change, I think 5 have been gay. It's allowed, but it's a rare and difficult thing. Meanwhile, gay marriages are prohibited in the PC(USA). Some Presbyterian Churches are more conservative on these issues, others are very liberal. Most are pretty split down the middle, with members that fall on both sides of the issue.  - Theologically, the PC(USA) tends to be far more influenced by the Karl Barth/Jurgen Moltmann kind of reformed theology than the neo-reformed John Piper kind of stuff you see in the PCA. In other words, we're not really focused on five point Calvinism, but rather more focused on grace and covenant community (that doesn't mean we rejected classical calvinism either, it's just we've kind of moved on asking more questions).  - Finally, the demographics are a bit different. While the PC(USA) is much larger than the PCA (2 million vs. 300,000), about 75% of the PC(USA)'s membership belongs to the largest 1,000 churches (there are about 10,000 or so congregations). That means there are tons of small, country Presbyterian churches out there, and they'll look quite different from the larger 1,000 or so. Those larger churches tend to be suburban, programatic, and younger than their smaller rural counterparts.  - It's a diverse denomination politically and theologically, but not racially or economically. We tend range from mildly conservative to very liberal, but the high steeples usually among the wealthiest churches on the block, second only to the episcopalians.  Let me know if you have any specific questions, and if you tell me a general region, I may even be able to recommend a church or two.  -Sincerely,  A PC(USA) pastor (and the husband of another PC(USA) pastor).",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.7472824267

Sometimes just having a casual conversation about religion online can blow up into someone arguing that you're clearly brainwashed, or that since God clearly doesn't exist (because science) you are simply following the pack, and unable to break free from group think.  There are various ways of reacting to this. Honestly I don't know how best to deal with things. I think that you have to keep in mind a few things. One is that if Religion is the cause of strife then it is better not to have it. I believe Abdu'l Baha said this, but I'm not sure so don't quote me.  As to dealing with the argument(I wish I could say discussion, but a lot of people are only interested in arguments). You might find that someone you are talking to keeps replying with a similar singular statement. This may happen here, considering how similar his frist two statements were.  This is always going to be a problem. The person isn't there to discuss, they are there to win, and they do this by being the last to respond to something. This is the biggest problem, so maybe I'll come back to it.  If someone has very one sided views on something, they may simply have been told it, but it is more likely that they are promoting it. For some reason they feel the need to tell people that their way is right. Unfortunately when you get into religious perspective a large number of people do this, and it makes for very difficult conversations. You need to respond as politely as you can. It helps to have some way of backing up your information. Sometimes it is good to ask someone for proof of what they are saying, but sometimes it is not. One problem is that if they can find a biased article then they can use that for proof. What that means is that if you want to use information you have to be able to show that your information is unbiased.  I recently read an article claiming that the Baha'i faith was a cult. It stated this, then went on to explain that all religions are kind of cults anyway, and that it is a spectrum with religion and cult lying on the spectrum. It went on to say that the Baha'i faith is on that spectrum, mostly because it is a young religion.  This made me realise two things. One was that in religious debate, people are not often using the same definitions, and this makes it so much harder to discuss issues. The second is that many many people will not realise that they are skewing information to fit their world view.  Both of these will make your discussion all that much harder. This opinion seems to be part of that person's world view, and also something that they are promoting. **What I am trying to say here is that you're probably not going to change their mind.** You need to step back and think about what it is you want out of this discussion. Do you want to change their opinion(near impossible), do you want to argue your corner with him or do you want to present information/facts and let others who see this decide what they think. There are other options of course, but I think those three are the main ones.  Personally I prefer option 3. If you present this information he might even read it. If he reads it he might even let it be. It's unlikely(again I'll explain why later) but it is possible. However what I would want to do here is to come away from this without anger, and without the feeling that other readers will be misinformed about my religion.  I would suggest that you think about how our core beliefs, and your way of life as a Baha'i goes against the definition of 'cult'.  We believe all world religions are from the same God: This means that we do not isolate ourselves from other religious thought. We are encouraged to be full members of society, and have no restrictions on who we can spend time with. Baha'is can (and often do) have friends from all walks of life, and all religions and non-religions schools of thought.  We believe that independent investigation of the truth is a core tenet of any faith: The Baha'i faith only allows members over the age of 15 to become Baha'is if they so choose. They are encouraged to take their time, to investigate fully all aspects of the faith. A Baha'i may withdraw their membership at any time they wish. Before this time they are considered too young to make such a decision. No baptisim or registry can be performed in any manner before this age.  Baha'is believe that ""Deeds, not words be your adorning"". This means that we engage in society by running social programs which encourage youth development, environmental conservation, building community(togetherness of a community) and assisting the needy among other things.  Finally, to address the political side. I do not know of any Baha'i politicians. Seriously, I don't know of any Baha'i who holds a political position in any government in the world. You might want to quote the law which states that we may not run in partisan politics. I really can not see how Baha'is could be a political organisation when we are not allowed to be part of partisan politics.  **Lastly** I've mentioned a couple of times about the argument not ending. There is a descent possibility of this. This may be one of those people who is there to win. One of the reasons I suggested you think of this as informing others about the faith in an unbiased way(in so far as you can) is that he probably will not let go of the argument. You could be responding to each other for the next couple of weeks (I have experienced this on many areas of reddit religious discussion. They only seem happy when I stop responding). Because of this you need to try and step away from arguing points on his terms. You state your case. If he counteracts with misinformation, or whatever just say that you encourage anyone (him included) to investigate the faith themselves. Say that they can message you if they are looking for further information.  It can become very difficult to address him at this point, and it is here that i tend to fall down. I don't like getting into a loop of 'he said she said' with someone, where they state their opinion over and over. However it is very hard for me to step away at this point too, and I still haven't figured out the right course of action. However hopefully someone else will weigh in on this point.","This is a glimpse into the beliefs, comments and ideals that bombard the life of a Baha'i in Iran.

I do encourage it to a certain extent. After all, I feel it is a decision for him to make on his own when he is old to enough to understand and do his own critical thinking. I will love him either way.   My problem lies in the fact that his Aunt and Uncle on his dads side (we are not together and he is in and out of his life whenever it feels convenient for him) were taking him to church without my permission. Their son goes to a private CRC school. Maybe they just assumed I was religious? After finding out about my atheism thanks to facebook, they now ask permission....most of the time.   In school, they have these tudor programs that are based out of a church. That's fine, but now they are coming to my door and taking him to youth group. My son wants to go because of his friend and the activities they do. He is quite naturally athletic. He 'says' he doesn't pay attention to the lessons, and I feel that is only to appease me. Now there is another group that has all these sports facilities and is a fundie youth ministry at the same time.   I feel he is almost being peer pressured into these activities to fit in with his friends and to be able to play the sports he loves. Then I end up feeling like the bad parent for not allowing him to hang with his buds and play sports. (He does play little league and rocket football, this is just fun, extra play time for him.)  My son and I talk about religion. I tell him he needs to know about it before he can have an opinion for or against, theistic or non-theistic. Also, judging some of the ridiculous things that come out of his mouth, for example, ""We don't have to take off our hats at the dinner table because we're not Christian."" I think he is having a hard time distinguishing the differences. I had to correct him in front of his friends and say that this was a fun dinner. That at a restaurant, hats would come off because that is etiquette. But he is also only 11 years old. I also don't want to take the religious path and force my beliefs down his throat. I want to be better than that. I feel like it is a game of tug of war right now. Any suggestions?","I don't have children and never will, so I can't offer you help. But it looks like you need to spend more time on etiquette with him, because I can't believe an *11* year old didn't know that taking your hat off at the table is because it's correct etiquette. Of course, I was pretty much miss manners by the time I was 3, so maybe I shouldn't hold everyone to my standard. Except my standard is simply to have gracious manners and follow the basic rules for a polite society like chewing with your damn mouth *closed*, so I think it's a good standard to hold people to. Why don't kids these days know this? My sister brings friends over and I just want to smack them for being so *disgusting*.  Sorry, off topic. It does sound like peer pressure though, maybe ask about what he 'learned' and then talk to him about science and theology and see if he actually believes what he was told, letting him figure out what he thinks feels true. I was always an atheist based on my own conclusions drawn from the world around me, and while I was pressured into activities like church camp, I never agreed with the crap they spouted. Your son could be the same as I was, and just doesn't want to make waves.","Lol! It's true. While I push the manners extensively, please, thank you, being polite, I have spent the better half of 11 years trying to instill etiquette, and it is like beating a dead horse. It's almost impossible for him to sit still during a meal. So, we are still working on that. Every. Single. Day.  But I think you may have made a great point, that he just 'doesn't want to make waves.'

So how does one turn around? By nonseeking seeking, seeking without seeking. This is precisely what people find hard to deal with or get into. How can you seek if you are not seeking? How can you not seek if you are seeking? If you only seek, how is that different from pursuing sounds and chasing forms? If you do not seek at all, how are you different from inert matter?  And then it follows...  &gt; You must seek, and yet without seeking; not seek, yet still seek. If you can manage to penetrate this, you will then manage to harmonize seeking and nonseeking. So it is said, ‚ÄúNonseek¬≠ing nonseeking‚Äî the body of reality is perfectly quiescent. Seek¬≠ing seeking‚Äî responsive function does not miss. Seeking without seeking, nonseeking seeking‚Äî objects and cognition merge, sub¬≠stance and function are one.‚Äù Therefore you find the three bod¬≠ies, four knowledges, five eyes, and six spiritual powers all come to light from this.

One line of thinking is why mormons can't say ""Jesus"", its always ""The Lord"". Even as a TBM it always bugged me and while its a small thing to nitpick on, it does show why mormons are viewed as non-Christian.   Here is the thought I stumbled upon: ""The Lord"" for mormons is an amalgamation of Jesus, God, covenants you make in the temple, prophets and the church versus ""Jesus"" who is a figure who personified grace, forgiveness, and kindness as a way for future Christians to strive for.  While mormons strive to be like Jesus, they work hard to be like The Lord, working breathlessly to follow exact obedience in rules and doctrines set up by the church and prophets.    Now me being a PIMO, maybe even a future ex-mo, I can see why people outside the church get so upset at moromons.  Jesus was not about rote repetitions of worship or working hard to support the status quo of the time.  He was in direct opposition to that and I think if he had anything to say about it today would be in direct opposition to the church as well.","Hello! This is a Cultural post.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/FAITH.jsonl,FAITH.jsonl,o4lbvx,Faith and Works: A Little Bit of Both?,"This has probably been discussed on here before, but I'm new and haven't reviewed a whole lot of posts/comments yet.  This is just the cliched, stereotypical issue of whether are we saved or ""justified"" - by whatever salvific agency or in whatever spiritual perpective - by faith, or by ""works"".  My own religious group is Jodo Shinshu / Shin Buddhism. Shin relies for our ultimate enlightenment- Bodhi / attainment of Buddhahood - solely on Amida/Amitabha Buddha's transcendental grace. We are saved by Shinjin or ""perfect faith"". However, this faith itself is from moment-to-moment provided by the Buddha. We have no hand in producing it. We rely only on the Buddha's transcendent ""Other-Power"" to receive the Shinjin which ""seals"" us for enlightenment in the next life, when we take birth in Amida's Pure Land. In Shin, perfect faith is unattainable via self-effort/self-power, but only through Amida's merit and grace.   In most Protestant forms of Christianity, however, *""sola fide""* or ""faith alone"" is also said to be the sole means of salvation. We are saved by faith alone, as Luther said, somewhat misquoting Paul. Curiously, the only instance of ""faith"" and ""alone"" in the Bible is in the Letter of James, where it says, ""No man is saved by faith alone"", and it recommends good works and Torah piety as a means of salvation. In the Gospels, Jesus says that ""because she has loved much, much has been forgiven her"", he forgives sins of people who have not made a creedal-doctrinal affirmation of faith, and he says that good deeds will be rewarded in heaven.  And obviously, as James also says, faith without works is dead. So it seems that faith and works together form a saving dyad that simply will not operate if either faith or works is omitted from the spiritual life.  Does your religious viewpoint affirm faith alone; faith-with-works, or something else...?  Finally, returning to the question of self-power vs other power. In Jodo Shinshu, as mentioned above, faith is required, but *we* are not required to *produce* it, because the Buddha does it for us. But is this also true in Christianity? Can it be argued that the Christian ""Act of Faith"" is itself a ""work"", not a sheer gift, as it is in Jodo Shinshu? If an ***act*** of faith saves us, then does ""faith alone"" / Protestant Christianity actually depend on the believer's conscious *act of the will* when s/he expresses faith in God/Jesus/the Atonement...?",There has always been a debate amongest Christians with regards to this subject and sometimes it's referred to work versus grace. Here are 3 videos that are very helpful and will give the way forward with regards to this subject.

Some theists *also* believe God punishes or rewards people *in this very life* for their moral behavior: God might bless a particularly good person or smite a particularly bad person.  I think these views are inconsistent. For heaven and hell, insofar as they are infinite, are supposed to be *consequentially sufficient* in the following sense. If hell doesn't take care of the punishment the wicked deserve, then nothing does, mutatis mutandis for heaven and the reward the good deserve.   But if the wicked deserve hell *in addition* to being smitten while alive, then that's because hell alone is not consequentially sufficient (mutatis mutandis for the good, heaven, and being blessed while alive). Hence, the wicked never deserve being smitten alive if they're going to hell, and the good never deserve being blessed alive if they're going to heaven.  So if miracles are understood as either blessings or divine curses, we have the following disjunction: either there are no miracles or there is no afterlife (at least as understood here, as a wondrous paradise or a terrifying hell).","It could be that blessings and curses are not rewards, but rather are signals, meant to communicate something, e.g., that certain character traits are praiseworthy or blameworthy.",Surely signalling greed is bad by inflicting horrifying diseases on the greedy is not the most competent way to go about.,comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.4959103252
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,12g7960,Which is the true Religion?,"Which is the True Religion?  If you say that your religion is the only path to God and that other paths lead to hell, I have one humble question for you. This question applies to followers of every religion without any trace of partiality. The simple question is: Today I have heard about your religion and if I follow it, I reach God while if I refuse, I will go to the hell for my own fault. This is very much reasonable. But before your ancestors discovered the country I come from, the scriptures or even the name of your religion was not known to My ancestors and they could not reach God for no fault of theirs. On the other hand, your ancestors followed your religion and reached God at that time. Even if I assume that My ancestors will take rebirth in the present time and will follow your religion to reach God, such a possibility is ruled out because you say that there is no rebirth for the soul. Thus My ancestors suffered forever for no fault of theirs. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that God must be partial. Had God been impartial, He would have revealed your religion to all countries at the same time. Had that happened, My ancestors might have also reached God as your ancestors did. Therefore your statement proves your own God to be partial.  Why must the partiality of God be eliminated to give way to impartiality? The impartiality of God isn‚Äôt necessary, but can be taken as true  if looking at the world from the concept of omnipotence. God being omnipotent, and thus omniscient, has no reason for partiality   The only way to make your God impartial is that you must accept that your very God appeared in all the countries in various forms at the same time and preached that only true path of your religion, in various languages. He did not appear in the same form everywhere and neither did He preach in the same language. However the subject matter was the same‚Äîdivine knowledge. The syllabus and explanations were one and the same, though the media of instruction (languages), external looks and names of teachers were different. Thus the religion that God gave to your people and country is not different from the religion that the same God gave to other people in other countries in different languages. Can you give any alternative reasonable answer to my My question other than this? Certainly not! Whenever you claim your religion to be the one and only path to God and whenever you condemn other paths, remember that any person belonging to any religion can pose this question to you.  Moreover every religion claims that their God alone created this world. Unfortunately this world is only one and every God cannot create the same world; there are not many worlds to justify each God creating His own world. Therefore any human being with an iota of commonsense has to agree that there is only one impartial God who created this one world. He alone came in different forms to different countries and preached the same path in all the languages, simultaneously at one time.  This is taken from Universal Spirituality for World Peace‚Äôs website","James 1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.","all religions are the same yet different. All serve a purpose and all were created for the people at that time. I imagine new religions will be made in the future when there is more technology and AI integrated in our every day lives. That being said, if you don‚Äôt follow the religion that doesn‚Äôt mean you are bad or will go to hell - depends on the religion. In Christianity and Islam you will be condemned, and they are more strict which I why I am not Christian or Muslim. In Hinduism if you fail your duties, are a bad person, you will be reincarnated into a form that allows you to work on your past failures/mistakes (karma). There is always time to improve because of reincarnation. This simple aspect of Hinduism for me is comforting and gives me grace. Yes there is heaven and hell, but the religion itself it more so focused on spirituality and growth with an open set of arms. I really dislike the fact that Christians will try to convert you and ‚Äòsalvage‚Äô you. Hindus will not because in the end they know you will be taken care of justly by the creator. Additionally, all gods can be true, all of us can be living in alternate timelines, reality can be a dream.

From what I have read I feel drawn to Trika Shaivism but want others people's explanations and ideas.,"I can only speak for my sect : veerashaiva jangam (shaivic brahmins)  We are traditionally priests and ascetic monks, but I and my family are just regular middle class family.   At initiation we are given a personal lingam to wear all the time. It is our primary object of meditation. Everyday it is recommended to practice meditation by looking at the lingam and chanting the secret mantra given to us at the time of initiation. The lingam is buried with the body on death (we bury our dead unlike other sects).  Going to temples is optional and not given importance as personal lingam should be given importance above everything else. As priestly class vegetarianism is strongly recommended, although I personally consume meat outside occasionally in social situations.   We're a small community spread across the country.   A notable social reformer Basavanna who was a Vaishnava brahmin and was treasurer for king Bijjala was deeply influenced by our school of thought and converted to veerashaiva. He led a movement against caste discrimination and is considered the founder of Lingayatism where devotees are called sharanas and all are treated equally. But fortunately or unfortunately lingayats do place us above in the social hierarchy, respect us as we perform rituals and rights especially marriage rights.",when did basavanna live?,comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.9399252489
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/progressive_islam.jsonl,progressive_islam.jsonl,ke3w7u,Sculpture vs Idol,"So, recently in my country (Bangladesh) there is a huge debate going on around this topic. Bangladesh is a Muslim majority country but our constitution is secular, but the numbers and popularity of Islamic fundamentalists have been rising day by day. There was a pretty big and aggressive showdown containing 10-20k people after the whole France debacle. People protested on social media as much as they could and in my opinion somewhat excessively. These people wanted the govt to end all political and economical ties with France and pressured govt to formally protest against the incident. So, I hope you can understand the situation in Bangladesh right now.  Recently, on the occasion of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib's (the father of our nation) 100th birthday, govt wanted to build a sculpture honoring him. The same Muslim fundamentalist then started protesting against this decision by giving a fatwa that sculptures are haram in Islam.  So I was curious and wanted to know what do you guys think? Previously these scholars also considered photos of live animals as haram, it seems like they all have accepted now that they are not. Videos are just strings of photos so that should be haram too? But videos are more popular than ever among them for preaching to people. Drawing of animals are still considered haram, but imagine a medical science, Zoology or Biology book without pictures of animals. Idols are strictly prohibited in Islam but what about sculptures that are built without any intention of worshipping? And should we Muslims care if someone chose to worship a sculpture as that definitely makes him a non-muslim, should we care about non-muslim activities? Plenty of Muslim countries have sculptures and statues that no one worships, so what's the harm? Also stumbled upon this - [https://muhammadabduh.net/verdicts-articles/what-is-halal-legal-haram-illegal/paintings-sculpture-arts-are-allowable-in-islam/](https://muhammadabduh.net/verdicts-articles/what-is-halal-legal-haram-illegal/paintings-sculpture-arts-are-allowable-in-islam/)  I should mention Bangladesh is not an extremist country by any means, it has festivals full of songs and dances, has a small entertainment industry worth around 10M USD. Sculptures already exist in the country and till now it seemed like no one had any problem with them. Some of them are even considered landmarks of the city. But suddenly the Islamic scholars want to break all the statues and they have huge following behind them. But what is right in this case?","In my opinion that is going out of hand at this point. Banning pictures? Sculptures? It is ridiculous. I mean if someone actually makes those sculptures and goes ahead and pray for it everyday maybe then people might give a damn. Then again if they are gonna do it and worship i dont know a picture of a cow the state should have no say in this. Religion is private.  Also from the get go its just banning pictures is just straight up infuriating. Your state is basically calling every single of its citizen either weak, or an idiot. Have you have no self-control or will? The point of living life is encountering problems, obstacles, being tested. If you ignore every single aspect human life in order to never do anything thats ‚Äúharam‚Äù (which these are not haram in the first place) then what was ever the point of existence in the first place. Then no one should ever go out and do anything so they never do anything that is haram? That is just stupid which I also believe that it is against Quran.   I remember that there was a story were Prophet Muhammed find this group of people who did nothing except for praying all day in the hopes that it would guarantee their place in heaven which haram on its own, im not too sure about how real this is though.   All things aside does Bangladesh think every single person living there is Muslim? Are people of other religions not allowed to practice their own religion? Rules should me made in way that it would fit everyones life style and no one should be forced into things.  ALSO I absolutely despise how authoritarian islamic states simply just ban anything that remotely resembles art? World is a beautiful place, as an artist myself and many other Muslim artists we aspire to express the beauty of the world in different mediums. Islam has nothing against art, but for some reason stupid states do. The reason why Eastern countries like Bangladesh or in my case Turkey is so behind is that we are stuck in this old toxic mentality (which is not even rooted in Islam itself) and instead of separating religion fully from politics politicians use it to control people. I cant imagine how many amazing artists are just simply being wasted. What a shame.  PS In Turkey sculptures are of course allowed, because one it is definitely not haram and two state has no say in what religion people can practice (unless if you start disrespecting others)","I wouldn‚Äôt consider the Hefazatis to be scholars, they are radical mullahs.

I identify as a reformed baptist and my family are members of a baptist church (leans very reformed, pastoral staff would all lean towards reformed baptist theology) that is in the south. On Wednesday evening they run a AWANA program. For those unfamiliar its your basic bible story, happy christian song, bible memory verse and game time children program. I never grew up with AWANA as being a part of my upbringing in the church. My wife grew up with it and won all the awards and trophies and plaques for bible memorization and she has some decent memories of it but even she is hesitant of the overly organized massive children's church programs and some of the negative/inauthentic tendency it seems to foster.   Does anyone have any experience with programs like this? What are the pros and cons? From the outside it seems like a heavily incentive bible memorization program/ christian cub scouts. I'm worried about the unnecessary pressure it puts on young children to memorize the bible for awards recognition. I do work on staff at the church and I lead a small home group and teach Sunday school and I am starting to get pressure from some of the AWANA leaders and other staff to have my kids attend the program. My kids are young and they are in a loving and highly dedicated christian home. We teach them the bible regularly in our home and they go to a christian school / daycare and get plenty of social interaction and bible stories there.","There's certainly an idea in some Christian circles that simply knowing bible verses by memory is good. I really don't subscribe to that way of thinking, but I also don't think there's anything bad about it either. So I'd say a children's club that promotes it is better than one that just promotes selling cookies.","It's pretty dependent on what the leadership and volunteers want it to be.   If it's thought of as a formal way to educate children in matters of faith and practice, then it can certainly be good in a reformed baptist setting where more formal catechism and creedal teaching may not be present.  However it can also set a harmful precedent that Christianity = fun. Then when participants age, and experience the not so fun, sometimes hard parts of Christian life, they can become disallusioned and fall away from the church.   Basically, it can be good or bad. My wife and I participated in similar programs in our youth, and we got mixed results from them. She knows scripture better than me because of the scripture memorization elements of the program she grew up in. Now, in my 30s, I have a really hard time memorizing scripture and find myself wishing that I'd done it in a more structured setting in my youth.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/RadicalChristianity.jsonl,RadicalChristianity.jsonl,n9fgzn,The Palestinian issue is in the news again because of sheikh jarrah. Here are some rebuttals to talking points you might here on this as well as social and theological reflections when it comes to justice for Palestine.,"**(i)Criticising Israel is antisemitic**   * Antisemitism is something that any serious justice minded person should take gravely, whether its antisemitism coming from the right or antisemitism coming from the left. And there should be no antisemitic tropes when speaking about anything, but especially this topic.  * Having said all of those disclaimers, one should never let the accusation of antisemitism deter one from criticising the Israeli government when it comes human rights abuses. When those who support Palestinian liberation condemn the Israeli government for bombing schools, bombing hospitals, engaging in repressive police action against Palestinian protesters demanding their rights, illegal settler activity that results in forced eviction, this is not antisemitism. This is a concern for human rights. So while antisemitism is a legitimate issue, never let it be used cynically to silence a commitment to Palestinian liberation.   **(ii)""Why do you criticise Israel but not other governments""**  * This is a statement that you will hear a lot. And the irony of this statement is that when supporters of the Palestinians say that the policies of the Israeli government constitute apartheid, this statement solidifies it. Here is why.  * This type of statement is a deflection tactic. And it is one that the apartheid government and its defenders used. When people would condemn apartheid south africa's racist policies, their defenders would say ""what about the Soviet Union, what about China, what about all of the surrounding African nations that have human rights abuses"". It is a tactic that is always used to deflection criticism of human rights abuses.  * The fact is that those who support Palestinian rights would freely support human rights in any other country. Many people in the Palestinian liberation movement support black lives matter. Many supporters of Palestine are critical of the human rights abuses in other countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia in terms of what they are doing in Yemen. So not only is this talking point a form of deflection, it is false.   **(iii)""Israel has national security concerns, that's why its doing what its doing"".**   * Every nation has national security concerns but this is another talking point that shows a similarity with apartheid south africa. When the Apartheid government was justifying its policies, it justified it partially on the grounds of national security. Specifically the Suppression of Communism Act of 1950 and the Terrorism Act of 1967 where on national security grounds they stated they were suppressing and banning organisations like the ANC. They also stated they had to do what they were doing because the ANC was a terrorist group.  * The fact of the matter is, national security can never be a justification for political repression because most governments that engage in oppressive policies use national security as a justification. China right now is using national security to throw uighur muslims in concentration camps. India uses national security to continue its occupation of Kashmir. The U.S government used national security in the 60s to justify its illegal FBI COINTELPRO where they infiltrated and repressed black and left wing groups including wiretapping MLK, Malcolm X and other leaders.   **(iv)""Hamas uses human shields""**   * This is also another talking point that's thrown around. Is it true Hamas has used human shields? Yes, and its reprehensible. However not every single Palestinian death is due to human shields. In the past couple of days the police have repressed Palestinian protesters who are being forcibly evicted from their homes. Where are the human shields that are being used by Hamas there? The Israeli airforced just initiated an airstrike where 3 children were killed. There was no evidence of human shields.  * The fact of the matter is both the Israeli security and armed forced have documented cases where human rights abuses have been practised. Repressive police action. Actions in war time that violate human rights. These include the use of depleted uranium and white phosphorus in the 2009 Gaza War. The bombing of a school where the IDF was warned 18 times that civilians were in their. The bombing of civilians on the Gaza beach. None of these had to do with human shields. They were just war crimes in these instances.   These are just some talking points that one might here that need rebutting. In terms of looking at this from a theological perspective, the first would be this. As Christians we worship a saviour Jesus Christ who was crucified under a military occupation. Therefore looking at the image of a crucified man on the cross who suffered under an occupation should put us in solidarity with any human being under occupation. Especially those in the Holy Land where occupation is being practised right now.   The second is that the scriptures clearly show that God is a God who is on the side of the occupied. In the Book of Judges, every time the Israelites were occupied, God raised up a Judge such as Deborah and Gideon to liberate them from their occupation.   The third is that the scriptures simply demand justice for the poor, widow, orphan and oppressed. Those are the Palestinians right now, and we have a social and theological commitment to them.","My take is that the people of Israel and Palestine are perfectly fine, it's the governments and extremists who are the issue.   I really don't like the lack of nuance in conversations on this topic tho, people really aggressively side one way or the other...  Good writeup tho.",Thanks for this,comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.629816074

The people who run this subreddit can delete it if this isn't allowed.    I'm a Baha'i in 11th grade in high school.  I've started feeling so sad and anxious since school started.  Everyday I'm so angry and anxious and sad. School is just the place to fall asleep, sit there silently, and fail every assignment in the day.  My grades are mostly D's, a few C's, an F, an A, and a B.  My teachers have complained to my counselor about how I act like a sleepy, mindless zombie or shaky, jumpy, and flustered some days.  I keep having anxiety attacks about the world.  I can't get myself to stop worrying.  Everything triggers worrying and bad thoughts that won't go away.  Its like paranoia about the world and sometimes the Baha'i Faith makes it better or worse.  I feel like I should kill myself because the world is awful and it's only going to get worse.  I don't have any motivation to do anything and I just wanna sleep all the time.  I can't focus on anything anymore.  I get distracted and then just stare at my work.  I'm angry at myself for being such a failure and a horrible, worthless, selfish b-tch.    I'm a horrible person and a useless waste of space.  I feel so angry at myself for being such a worthless whore when their are people who are really suffering like in Iran.  I cry to Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha and pray One of them will come to me in a dream and tell me it's alright.  I'm sorry if this isn't allowed.","Hi sadbahai,   Please know that you are not alone, many of your peers will have the same feelings you do but not know who to share them with.  I want you to know there are steps you can take to start feeling better, feeling less anxious, less paranoid and more like the valuable, unique, gifted human being that you are. You've already taken the most important step which is recognizing that there is something you would like to change.  You are not horrible, you are a creation made in God's image. You are not worthless, because Baha'u'llah has created you noble, you are not a waste of space because you have Baha'u'llah in your heart and there are so few lovers of God in this world, you are not defined by your failures or those moments when you feel selfish, you are defined by your love for God and how you help others. Your pain and suffering is real, the fact that others have suffered too or in a different way does not make your experience any less real. Baha'u'llah will undoubtedly protect, guide, help and heal you.  It starts with prayer, like this one  &gt; Lauded and glorified art Thou, O my God!  I entreat Thee by the sighing of Thy lovers and by the tears shed by them that long to behold Thee, not to withhold from me Thy tender mercies in Thy Day, nor to deprive me of the melodies of the Dove that extolleth Thy oneness before the light that shineth from Thy face.  I am the one who is in misery, O God!  Behold me cleaving fast to Thy Name, the All-Possessing.  I am the one who is sure to perish; behold me clinging to Thy Name, the Imperishable.  I implore Thee, therefore, by Thy Self, the Exalted, the Most High, not to abandon me unto mine own self and unto the desires of a corrupt inclination.  Hold Thou my hand with the hand of Thy power, and deliver me from the depths of my fancies and idle imaginings, and cleanse me of all that is abhorrent unto thee.  &gt;Cause me, then, to turn wholly unto Thee, to put my whole trust in Thee, to seek Thee as my Refuge, and to flee unto Thy face.  Thou art, verily, He Who, through the power of His might, doeth whatsoever He desireth, and commandeth, through the potency of His will, whatsoever He chooseth.  None can withstand the operation of Thy decree; none can divert the course of Thine appointment.  Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.  &gt; Baha'u'llah  It starts with affirming that God is in control of your life  &gt; O God! Refresh and gladden my spirit. Purify my heart. Illumine my powers. I lay all my affairs in Thy hand. Thou art my Guide and my Refuge. I will no longer be sorrowful and grieved; I will be a happy and joyful being. O God! I will no longer be full of anxiety, nor will I let trouble harass me. I will not dwell on the unpleasant things of life.       &gt; O God! Thou art more friend to me than I am to myself. I dedicate myself to Thee, O Lord.  Do not worry about your grades, they mean nothing once you get to college, I had all C's, D's and F's in high school and was just accepted to Cal Poly after saving tons of money going to a community college for 2 years.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_active/TrueChristian.jsonl,TrueChristian.jsonl,3aom7a,[Christians Only] Is it possible to be in a state of belief/repentance and not be saved?,"Edit: Forgive me for the long post, but please read all of it. Thanks!  Would it technically be possible to have all the faith in the world, faith that is so strong, it's as if you've actually met Jesus face to face (I'm talking literally face to face, not spiritually, metaphorically, etc.), or even just a normal amount of faith, and not be saved? Clearly, the Bible teaches that salvation is based on the works of Jesus Christ, and not the works of yourself, and to get saved, one simply has to believe, but not just mere belief, but have full trust in Jesus Christ.   &amp;amp;nbsp;  However, the Bible mentions some unforgivable sins. Such include blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, apostasy, adding to or removing scripture, etc. What if, hypothetically, one were to commit one of these sins, but still absolutely trust Christ alone for their salvation?   &amp;amp;nbsp;  The reason I ask this, is that although plenty of time has passed, I still can't get this notion out of my head that I'm not saved due to losing faith from age 14 to 18. I've posted a couple of threads about this in the past, but I still can't find peace. The Bible seems to mention a lot of times that one must endure in the faith to make it to Heaven. There's just numerous pieces of scripture that suggest that you have to stay in the faith until the day of death to make it to God's Kingdom. I can't find a single piece of scripture anywhere in the Bible that suggests that one can lose faith temporarily and still be saved. It just doesn't seem biblical. And please don't tell me about the Parable of the Prodigal Son. That is NOT about a follower of Christ who becomes lost and is found again. That, like the two parables before it in Luke, is talking about man's original fall from sin (the boy departing his father) and man being reconciled with God through Jesus Christ (the boy returning home after living a sinful life). The two parables before this one has Jesus explicitly describing the parables saying that there is more joy over one sinner that repents than the 99 righteous men that need no repentance (those aren't the exact words, but I'm on my phone so I can't provide any Bible verses at the moment). And also, please don't tell me that *all* sins are forgiven through Christ. While that is true, the Bible warns against strong sins that are unforgivable for a reason. So it seems to be that all sins are forgivable, except the unforgivable ones (obviously).  &amp;amp;nbsp;  My current situation is that, while having lost my faith from 14-18, I am now in the faith, and have been for almost a year. To be completely honest, my faith is 1,000x stronger than before I walked away from the Lord. I believe in Christ to the point where it's literally impossible for me to believe in anything else. Plus, since I turned back to the Lord, I've produced life-changing habits in a good way. Without even asking for God's help, I've been completely delivered from all addictions I had, with the exception of tobacco, it's the toughest habit to kick. Even then, I still go long periods without smoking before I start up again. Plus, I also feel like I love people, I also love my dad 10x more than I ever have (I didn't really feel much love for him in my teenage years, as much as I hate to admit it). I've become extremely patient with people who's main goal in life is to make others mad. I also am not quick to get angry anymore. I cuss a heck of a lot less now. I actually hardly ever cuss anymore, except when I'm tired or angry. I rarely ever say the Lord's name in vain. I just feel like my heart's been completely changed since I turned back to God. I even think differently now. It's like that ""crisis in faith"" taught me a valuable lesson, and forever strengthened my faith in Christ.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  But I can't enjoy church anymore now. Every time I participate in worship, I feel too guilty to feel the positive, happy, Spirit-filled effects. I've strayed away from reading the Bible as well, due to the numerous mentions of falling away and not being forgiven for it. And before I learned about the whole falling away thing, I loved to read the Bible and worship God. I really enjoyed my Christian life. But now I am on the verge of giving up. I feel like God doesn't want to be in my life anymore, being that I can't find any scripture supporting the forgiveness of backsliding. I constantly pray for answers and guidance, but I go unanswered. Also, 90% of my other prayers are unanswered as well. My life is just so empty now. Man, it felt GREAT to be alive in Christ again when I first returned. Now it's as if I am trapped in a forever-guilty conscience and had all the benefits of being a follower of Christ sapped away. I've also had a total of 3 panic attacks since I learned about this whole falling away/apostasy thing. I want my life back. I want peace again through Christ. I hate my new life of guilt and persistent reminders of my past. I've been so tempted to give up everything. I've had thoughts of suicide. I justify them because apostates were put to death in the Old Testament anyway. If I am an apostate and I am to burn in hell, why prolong the inevitable? The only thing that kept me from doing it is that I would hate to traumatize my family.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  So what do you people think about this? Is it possible to be in a state of belief/repentance and still not be saved due to past sins? And if you can, please back up your answers with as much scripture as possible. Call me old fashioned, but if it isn't in the Bible, I'm not much concerned with the answer (please don't take me as being rude. If I'm being rude, it's because it's almost 1:00 AM and I haven't gotten much sleep lately).  &amp;amp;nbsp;  PS: Please don't suggest that I go see a doctor. I don't feel getting high on anti-depressants will be the solution to anything. Finding the root of my current situation and dealing with it is what will cure my anxiety and depression, not pills. It's always wise to deal with the problem, not the symptoms.",What do you think St. Peter and St. Thomas are up to right now?  (my use of St. gives away my answer),"Apostasy is represented in the Bible in the story of the Old Testament. Israel is represented as the bride of God, and Israel's falling away from its covenant with God into polytheism is represented as adultery. The writings of the major prophets are all about how God will create a new covenant with Israel one day despite the fact that they really don't deserve it. It is the reason why God was united with his people in Christ, so that in death the bonds of the old covenant were broken. As in, till death do they part. This allowed the new covenant to be made. The story of Hosea puts it simply: he marries Gomer the prostitute who later leaves him and commits adultery, representing apostasy.

I have personal experience with the churches in Europe and Asia.   I am less familiar with Mexico, Central and South America, Africa, and French Polynesia.

I would say that the vision of Zion, the Peaceable Kingdom, is a distinctive part of Community of Christ theology everywhere, and there is a strong desire to promote such conditions in the local communities.  The services look quite different in many of the areas, and one of the biggest differences is in the music.

Spend more time mentally alone w Allah.   It's the mindset of some of the more conservative Muslims to blanketly call things haram, when what they mean to say is that they're bad for some reason. I think of it as an intuition that's misfiring bc they haven't developed the ability to discuss things critically w ppl who disagree w them.   I think what many are trying to express is: it's one goal of Islam to help us be mentally resilient and capable of being content and grateful (finding tasleem) without needing *anything* else. Not entertainment, not riches, not anyone's approval. Comfortable being alone w Allah.   But it's your personal journey to figure out how to get there, and there's no magical destination, but rather simply the journey throughout your lifetime.

What makes people continue believing in their specific religion? How do you know that you are right, and that another person who is from another religion believes he is right even more fiercely is wrong?","It‚Äôs just a matter of faith. The faith is enforced by culture, traditions and sometimes insecurity. That‚Äôs how I see it as an infidel.","I think for many people, religion is comforting. It answers the scary questions of where did we come from and where do we go when we die. It helps many people find meaning and purpose in their lives.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/progressive_islam.jsonl,progressive_islam.jsonl,dsnljw,"For a ""Clear book"", the Qur'an isn't that clear, and we need to acknowledge that.","Salam  Some of you may have encountered my previous post on the sub, and may notice a shift in tone in this one towards a more irreverent position. As was the case before, this is a bit of a rant. It is representative of my current state of mind. You may find the way I speak irreverent, but make no mistake: I believe in God and the Qur'an, so(especially to any ex-muskims who may read this) this should not be taken as an announcement of disbelief or a sign of the slow descent(or ascent, depending on who you ask) into apostasy. With that being said I am not happy to be a Muslim, and I am not willing or motivated to discuss Islam and what Islam stands for anymore because I don't have a way to prove conclusively that my perception of Islam is the true one.  I mention ex-muslims because some of the folks at r/exmuslim seemed to enjoy the previous post, and it's not hard to see why. I don't think I'm capable of subscribing to atheism, so I won't be joining that particular camp either. However, I am increasingly frustrated with Islam and with the Qur'an.¬†  The reason for this probably has to do with the way I converted to Islam. I studied a translation of the Qur'an with some commentary on and off for a long time before converting, and ever since, I've been reading the text pretty obsessively. You could say that in some ways, I have been a little ""serious"". Recently though, I'm increasingly burnt out, frustrated and angered by the state of the religion. I have been convinced that Muslims have strayed from the Qur'an, but frankly I don't even know whether my understandings are right anymore, and I don't see any reason to believe the interpretations of anyone else because they could be wrong, and some of these imams are teaching clearly stupid or immoral interpretations.¬†  This all stems from one fundamental problem in my opinion. So let's face it:¬†  **The Qur'an is just not very clear.**¬†  At least, it's not as clear as we are meant to believe that it is. There are way too many disagreements over what words mean even among people who are ostensibly native speakers of the Arabic language. Remember that about 20% of Muslims worldwide are Arabs. Perhaps at best 25% of Muslims worldwide even speak and understand Arabic, let alone the classical Arabic of the Qur'an. So how on earth am I supposed to know what anything means? As someone who created a subreddit for people to post personal understandings and interpretations(r/Marifa if anyone cares), this is a source of immense personal frustration and anger for me.  Barring certain niche(and often Quranist) translations, much of the Qur'an is translated into English in a reasonably uniform manner. However there are those verses and words that seem to be a source of constant debate and distortion. The Qur'an almost tauntingly tells us that there are such verses and only God knows the correct meaning.¬†  Thanks, God. Really makes my already difficult job more difficult.¬†  Should this plurality of meanings instill us with humility in the face of this uncertainty, and encourage us to be willing to listen to others? Sure. But it doesn't, does it? And it's not helpful, is it? No, it's bloody frustrating. If I'm devoting a lot of time to study a book, I want to be able to know that I understand what the hell is being said. I don't even think learning Arabic will help, because so many Arabic speakers have wildly different understandings and interpretations. If some of the Qur'an-only people are to be believed, almost all Muslims throughout history have misunderstood the Qur'an and followed distorted teachings. How am I supposed to know what the hell is the correct understanding? All these people speak Arabic, they can't agree universally on what words mean? So much for ""a clear book"".¬†  Am I supposed to be happy with this? Am I supposed to say ""mashallah, this plurality of meanings shows the wisdom of Allah"". Yeah sure, this is probably true for some verses. But when there is a verse that can be interpreted as at the very least given men permission to hit their wives, it's pretty damned important for us to get that right. I don't believe the verse was ever meant to be understood that way given the overall tone of how marriage is supposed to be in the Qur'an, but you can't bloody deny that this is one of the meanings of that word.¬†  Maybe it was clear when Muhammad was alive because everyone spoke this kind of Arabic. But it's been close to a millenium and a half, and nobody seems to be able to establish conclusively what some of these verses and words mean anymore. Maybe this was the case even in his lifetime. Who the hell knows for sure? They're all dead, and all the people narrating the ahadith themselves are dead, and many of them were probably liars. So much for God not wanting to make things difficult for us.  Thanks, God.   Beyond the actual linguistic meanings of words, there the even bigger question of which events some of the verses are referring to. When major sects draw some of their positions from supposed events they think verses refer to, it's pretty bloody important for me to know what the actual history is. But apparently that's too much to ask. Apparently God decided those details weren't important or that somehow omitting them would be conducive to the preservation of the text. I'm not one to question the decisions of an omniscient being, but when you want me to follow your scripture, and doing that it is fraught with such difficulties, you'd better be as merciful as you say you are and cut me some effing slack.  ¬†  Thanks, God.","Quran is actually surprisingly upfront and direct with everything we need to know. Islam is a very easy religion if practiced purely from it. Most don't, and you'd be right to point that out. You don't need to be a linguistic expert in Arabic to get the message of God. You are judged to your capacity and things that stem deep (conscience, intention, sincerity). This is very strongly emphasized and if you know you're playing those cards right you should be very optimistic about your judgement.  Yes, SOME verses are unclear, and that is INTENTIALLY done (3:7). I'm not judging your intention, but you should spare a ponder upon this verse. God doesn't need you, you need Him. The tone of your post seems to reflect a sense of self entitlement.   *""It is He who has sent down to you, the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific.

He (the critic) says that it is possible because he is a man who understands when he listens. If he says that, you say to him, How do you know? He might mean other than the meanings that you think‚Äù  I think the Quran and the hadiths ambiguous nature make it challenging, but if ‚ÄúAllah willed, They would have made you one nation, but [They intended] to test you in what They has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and They will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.‚Äù   As for gods preservation of the important stuff, yeah, that‚Äôs true, the history‚Äôs is particularly messy, yet the important stuff is all there, one thing I noticed is that every Shia imam left at least one thing behind, either in Hadith or in historical events, that are clear, not in the sense that it‚Äôs a blunt statement, but in the sense that it‚Äôs an authentic event that emphasizes principle and values over law, order, and ritual  Edit: As for the actual need to learn Arabic, again, something that‚Äôs confused me as well, this really just boils down to the specific verses, the principles are all there, and even if one doesn‚Äôt understand Arabic, interpretation is still open for them through translation or learning yes you do need to learn Arabic to get the absolute full experience, but even if you know modern Arabic it‚Äôs not gonna help that much, in any case learning quranic Arabic is just an educational advantage, and only serves (once again) to interpret the unclear verses. This is in addition to the fact that quranic Arabic is a separate entity from the commonly spoken Arabic even at that time, the assumption that the interpretations were clear at the prophets time is false as well, people were confused as shit, the prophet himself had verses he disliked and didn‚Äôt repeat (such as the wife beating verse), and people derived their own interpretations, debated them, etc.  In summary, yeah it‚Äôs confusing as shit, no that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôve deviated from it, all it means is that neither the Quran, the Hadith, or our own personal experiences are greater than one another, but can work together, by emphasis on principle rather than ambiguities, you can see this in Muslims like those in terror groups or who practice extreme conservatism, they practice in a manner emphasizing their interpretations of ambiguities rather than the principles that act as their support, fuck that, I‚Äôve seen your posts, you‚Äôre an objectively good Muslim, don‚Äôt beat yourself up cause you might have to learn quranic Arabic, or because the Quran is weird on some topics, just relax, and focus on the principles, everything else is supplementary",comment_2,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/TrueChristian.jsonl,TrueChristian.jsonl,ttjg96,My entire view on everything changed when I realise what God made me for (and all of you!),"Friendship with God. God's main purpose to create us all is to be His friend. I'm going to speak about myself here but if anyone can relate, be my guest and prayerfully this post will bless someone out there, even just one.  After many ""why's"" toward God and many pains from all kinds and many aspects of life I've gotten to realise that my period of being isolated from everyone for a few weeks only strengthened my faith in the Lord. In addiction I've gotten healed from all kinds of troubles.   You see, when we feel suicidal, it's because we're hopeless. When we feel worthless it's because we were abused, hated, not appreciated by someone, not cared. When we're depressed it's because we don't see any hope (not speaking of the unfortunate who were born with depression). When you're anxious, it's because you don't have trust. When you fear, it's because you don't have trust and faith.  What is faith? Faith is the ability to trust something or someone for this post's purpose, without seeing anything. Or else that would be seeing and walking, but faith, in faith you walk without knowing where the Lord will guide you toward, you don't know what's awaiting for you the next hour, I don't know if I'm going to die when I go outside after posting this post, but I trust the Lord.   Why are we called to trust God? Because:   He has given us too many reasons to count so that we may trust in Him. Everyone has different given levels of faith but everyone (who believers in Jesus) has some sort of faith inside them. Who's more who's less.   Faith gives you the assurance you're in God's hands. That the Lord sees you, knows you more than you know yourself. Faith is the assurance God won't let anything happen to you unless He orchestrated it to, unless you're out of His will then you will pay the repercussions to your wrong decision making which is highly to happen being outside His will.   Faith is the assurance God leads you, gives you strength, has a plan for you. Yes, He has a plan for you ""but I don't know what it is"" well go on and ask the Lord to lead you to His plan, His purpose for your life and see what the Lord does with your life. You'll never be able to imagine what the Lord can and will do when you submit to Him.   When you're walking by faith, everything changes, but most of all some of you might be like me. I see God as my judge, my Lord, my Savior, my Lover, other titles I might've missed. All of that does have some fear in it, think of it - who do you speak to? A human? No. You're speaking to a Holy being, can you realise that? Have you ever stopped and thought ""what in the world is happening. A divine being and I are speaking!?"" Not only that - He is inside of you. You have a divine being, all the God-head inside your body. It's His temple.   So that's good and all that (no disrespect meant here toward the Lord) but we might still fear. Look at what God did in the past, look at what God does or allows to happen to people and in the world (for many reasons I won't get into now) but how do you remove that fear, literal fear?   By being His friend. Listen, not only you're MADE to be His friend as the main purpose, would you fear some stranger hurting you, maybe betraying you, your trust if you knew they're capable of hurting you for their sinful desires or what not? Lemme tell you: You would. People hurt each other all the time no matter the reason.   God is good, He knows everything about you, first moment you came to life, your last second and breathe, God knows your deepest, darkest secrets, God knows your thoughts - He reads them. God knows who you are, your past, present, who you will be in the future, yet what does He do? Bless us, show us grace, give us love, affection, friendship be ready through His son, gives us eternal security, gives us hope, gives us Himself in the flesh-  Jesus, His beloved son for us.    Would you trust a sinful human being like me and you and every human, or a living, Holy, amazing, awesome in power, who wants you, loves you, cares for you, for your smallest of pains and struggles to the major ones, and is telling you He won't hurt you just because, He wants the best for you.   When you realise all you'll ever want and need is in God, and that's a long process that's where your life will change. You can speak to Him as your judge, as your Lord, but have you ever spoke to Him as a friend? Keep your tongue in place meaning don't say sinful things in His presence like dirty jokes, He hates that, but speak it out. Let your deepest secrets out, He already knows them, why hide it? Let yourself speak to Him at all times. And then you'll see you have security, hope, joy, peace that no matter what happens it's for your good, you'll have so many good things I cannot begin to even write it unless I want to keep y'all here for hours in this post.  When you are a friend of God, you have hopes of healing. all the Psalms are written over that, you're like a city being circled by an army, where in every angle you're under ""attack"" like those fantasy movies? That's how I'd say - God is watching all over you, all over your areas in life, He knows your condition, health, financial. When you get to know Him so deeply, I'm telling you, no pain will ever get higher than the love and joy and peace in His presence. Some of us suffer lots, I'm not degrading the power of pain, but pain is the best tool to bring us to the Lord as well.  That's how my heart was healed from a massive chain of losses in life, hopelessness since I was 12, watching my dreams die in front of my eyes, hating myself, life, people, my family, being resentful, lonely, sad, alone, name negative emotion I can guarantee you I felt it in my life. Who fixed it all?   God.   Go to Him, speak to Him, ask Him to make you love Him a little bit more today, to know Him a little bit more today, to be guided, empowered, motivated to find His perfect plan for your life, His purpose for your life and what is His will for your life. Be open, be free, He loves you as you are. No more self-loathing, I've a strong sense some of you who'll read this are self-loathing as I have in my life, it's a sin to do that, but that is for another day and post.  May the Lord guide you, bless you, show you His grace to an extent you'd never imagine by your own. May the Lord give you peace, joy, and revelation either from me being a tool for His glory, or someone else, to how deeply, wonderfully, perfectly He loves you. No matter what you do, He will always love you. In Jesus' name I pray.",Thank you for this  God bless,"i just want to say every time i see you post here i get excited to see what the Holy Spirit has you say, and i relate to a lot of what you say or i learn something.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/IslamicStudies.jsonl,IslamicStudies.jsonl,mu6lcd,What does Islam think about animal sacrifices from the old testament?,Hi! I am debating a Christian friend of mine. She says that in the old testament people would have to sacrifice an animal to have their sins forgiven. Until Jesus came and fulfilled this law. Is this true? (The part about animal sacrifices not Jesus fulfilling the law),"This is true, in previous nations, one of the ways even the Jews would know a Prophet was truly from Allah was if they made a sacrifice (obviously an animal, not a human, or a plant) and a fire from the sky consumed it. This is mentioned in Sura ƒÄl ‚ÄòImrƒÅn","As a layman and ex-christian, she's referring to Hebrews 9:22, which misquotes Leviticus 17:11. Jewish theologians have a problem with this interpretation as the assumption is that all sins required blood sacrifice for atonement. The reality is that sin sacrifice was reserved for serious occasions and the annual temple sacrifice for ""unintentional sins"" (Numbers 15:27). There were other means of astoning for sin that did not require blood sacrifice, like prayer and repentance, for example. It's very important to read Levitivus 17:10, the preceding verse, as well. In context it makes it clear that 17:11 is merely stating that blood should not be eaten because it is *a* form of atonement, not *the* form of atonement as Hebrews claims.  I would counter by citing Ezekiel 18, which states that the righteous cannot atone for the wickedness of others. Psalm 51:18, 40:6, and Hosea 6:6 also state that blood sacrifice is less than ideal for God. Ask her to compare Hebrews 9:22 and Leviticus 17:11, then ask her to compare Hebrews 10:5-6 with Psalm 40:6. Compare them yourself of course. I would recommend the ESV for the least biased translation.",comment_2,"References text from literature,

On the one hand, there seems to be this large consensus among scholars that the events described in Exodus are purely mythical, lacking a real historical basis.   Something being mythical is not necessarily a problem, of course. Many Christians view the Genesis creation story as communicating more symbolic messages than historical/scientific ones.  But the case seems different with the Exodus narrative. It‚Äôs clear that these events are extremely pivotal to Judaism. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs clear that the Jews seemed to (and continue to) treat these events as fully historical. And in so far as the writers of the New Testament treat the events of the Exodus as pivotal to God‚Äôs interaction with history, the historicity of Exodus seems very important to Christianity as well.  On a purely anecdotal level, it seems totally absurd to me to suggest that the Jews simply imagined events such as Passover and the exodus from Egypt. I can‚Äôt imagine how the biblical authors could just conjure this memory out of thin air to a people very cognizant of their national story and oral traditions.  So my question is, do you know of any good historical defences of the Exodus story?

We also ""lack historical evidence"" for a lot of major figures whose existence we take as fact. For many, our only empirical proof of their existence is someone mentioning them once in this or that history, letter, etc.  The biggest piece of evidence we have for the events of Exodus is the book of Exodus itself, but many secular historians write it off bc of its ""bias.""   Of course, by those standards, we have very little evidence that Abraham Lincoln existed, and it would be very easy to say that Lincoln was likely a myth fabricated by the Union post-civil war as a foundation character for the newly rebuilt america (like romulus and remus for rome) which is also why he was conveniently assassinated right at the end of the war.

I feel so raw and helpless.   I have always considered myself a spiritual person, open to religion. But I‚Äôve never really jumped into it. I think that‚Äôs always been my go to statement just to bypass the awkward conversations.   But as I sit here in bed picking up a bible for the first time in probably 15 years. I find myself hoping to find answers to my raw depression that has been eating at me for years now, but has finally intended to eat me whole.   I would appreciate positive guidance of any kind.","First before I say anything else, definitely look into getting a therapist.  Second, what are you struggling with? Maybe I can help you find something in that dauntingly massive collection of stories you‚Äôll relate to.  I have not read the entire Bible, but I have read the first 5 books (The Torah/The Law), the 4 Gospels, Revelation, and a few other books.  As a general rule, I usually tell people to start with the 4 Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), because that‚Äôs the foundation of the faith: Jesus. Everything else is context. If you start with The Law you will be reading 5 books filled with 613 rules to keep track of, many of which are impossible to observe unless you live in Israel. Jesus simplifies those 613 rules into 2 giant umbrella rules: love God and love your neighbor. The only Law is Love. That‚Äôs His foundation for everything He does in the Gospels.  I went through some pretty rough mental health issues several years back, and I had an encounter with God that taught me that God doesn‚Äôt just wave a magic wand to fix my problems because if God solved my problems for me all the time I would never get to enjoy the wonder that is personal growth. But God is always walking right beside me through all my trials, whether I know He‚Äôs there or not. I‚Äôm far from a perfect man, but as long as God sees me trying my best that‚Äôs all He cares about.  God is walking beside you too. You may have an encounter with Him, or you may not, but He‚Äôs there.  Look up Romans 5:3-5 and James 1:2-4. I think those may resonate with you.  EDIT: My struggles became a vessel through which I now use to help others with mental health issues for a living. God answered my prayer.","My Pastor always told me to start reading in John. God will give you clarity if you pray and ask Him for it. I am personally going through a really difficult time right now and I don't know how I could do it , if it wasn't for my faith in Jesus Christ.

Paul speaks about factions, which I take to be the same kind of division similar that I am talking about here, in 1 Corinthians and Galatians, but he's not explicitly clear. Anyways, what do you think? Is denomination divisive?","As an atheist, and thus an outsider looking in on this sort of issue, I think ""divisive"" is a fitting term.  If you count the broad list of Christians and ask their beliefs, people disagree on lots of things, including but not limited to the existence of hell, the nature of hell, the nature of sin, the nature of salvation, what salvation requires, who (you or god) salvation is dependent upon, whether or not free will exists or is necessary, whether or not there was a literal garden of Eden, whether or not such a literal garden is necessary, whether or not Genesis 1 is to be taken literally or metaphorically, whether or not said interpretation is demeaning to god, whether god hates or loves homosexuals, when you're supposed to be baptized, whether or not you should be making money, how much money you should be giving away, what political role the church should play, how best to spread the good news, how important the Virgin Mother is, and whether or not Joseph Smith was a prophet.  And so on, and so forth.  Excepting that last one, which causes enough of a division to be a separate religion, there are sects that fall all over the place in terms of such questions and more.  By definition, these differences divide you; a number of sects are mutually exclusive with other forms of Christianity.  One might assume that keeping in mind those bits about loving God with all your heart, soul, and mind and loving your neighbor as yourself would prevent such divisions from becoming destructive, but...well, in my experience at least, it seems that you can argue about *those* bits too.

Or to put it another way, what does it mean to be male/female (and other) outside of cultural descriptions?  *  How does gender apply to God?  *  Are we forever gendered or is there an androgynous goal ahead?    *  How do the genders relate in a way that is ""holy"" or ""Biblical""?  Both within marriage and in society in general.  *  Does gender dictate certain roles and functions?","* That question sort of broke my brain.   * I don't think it does, generally, other than Jesus referring to God as his Father, that and Jesus himself being male.  That's two out of three persons of the Trinity.   * Unknown, though if we are physically raised from the dead, then it stands to reason that we retain our identity.   *  I came back to this one.  I'm going to combine my answer with the last one, as I think they are kind of intertwined.  Maybe not completely, but I just woke up.  :) * I think, and this is just an opinion, that we are generally biologically inclined to sway towards certain things.  Neither traditional nor non-traditional gender roles are degrading.  Part of marriage is working as a team, playing off of each other's strengths in ways that complements each other.  Love God, love people, love each other like no other.  There isn't much room for superiority in that.  That, I think, is where holiness comes in, setting yourselves apart for the glory of God in a way that is pleasing to Him.  Maybe it's being married for going on 10 years that gives me the mindset that I have, but for me it is difficult to separate the topic at hand from marriage.","To most of those questions, I can only say, um, I Dunno. I'm afraid any answer I give would have to be prefaced with ""I speculate that..."" and that's not theology, it's just imagination.  But this one:  &gt; How does gender apply to God?    I think that needs two answers...  In the Incarnation, the Word became a human. Not just the idea of humanity, but a specific human being, with a nationality and a sex and all. Jesus Christ was a man. And, unless the Resurrection is completely ungendered, He still is.  But the Godhead - the divine nature and the three Persons - is not embodied, so biological sex isn't a category that applies. The pre-Abrahamic word El referred to a specifically male deity, and YHWH is likewise only ever referred to as ""he."" Asherah, El's consort, stubbornly keeps popping up until the Exile finally teaches the Jews monotheism - yet Asherah as an idea or character never merges with YHWH the way El does. It seems God was content to be called a *He* among the Hebrew people he was bringing into existence.   I can't imagine a possible theology that imputes sex to the Godhead, or even a nonphysical gender. And I'm fully aware that in creating and shaping the Hebrew nation out of Semitic raw material, God was working with people who had existing religious archetypes and gender roles - so I wouldn't try to read God's choice to be called a *He* as God's *being* in any meaningful sense male.  But I also tend to honor his choice. In a patriarchal culture, God chose to say in effect ""My relationship to you is in some ways like that of a father: a provider, an authoritarian, a soldier, an owner and buyer and seller, an offerer of sacrifices, and someone whose name and nature and property you inherit."" Because God has used almost exclusively masculine images and self-descriptions, I'm reluctant to consider re-envisioning God as Goddess.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.5409824569

I'm a little confused on this.,"There‚Äôs a couple analogies that can help wrap your head around it, for example the egg analogy. There is a shell, yolk and an egg white, and altogether there is one egg. The 3 parts create one unified whole.","The notion of the Trinity is something that really has no analog in our experience. I think to understand this it requires, at minimum, a shift in thinking about what it means to be God. Typically when people hear that there is one God, the implicit assumption is that God exists as a singular instance. I think the shift is to think about God not as being equivalent with an instance, but an essence which can exist in multiple instances.   To be God means to partake in the essence of God; i.e., to have the attributes of God (eternality, aseity, omniscience, omnipotence, moral perfect, etc...) If you make this shift, it becomes more intelligible how there can be one essence that is God (monotheism) yet three persons who partake in that essence (the Trinity).   Just in the same way that the color red is a singular property, yet there are many instances of things which participate in having the property of being red. If I have three red chairs of exactly the same color, I would not say there are three colors among my chairs. I would say there is one color, red, and three chairs which *are* red. In the same way I believe when we say there is one God, we refer to the property, or set of properties that comprise the essence of what God is. It turns out that there are three persons who hold that essence. So there is one God (the essence), but three people (the instances) who *are* God.   It can still be hard for us to understand precisely what this means. I think it's helpful to think of a person in terms of consciousness. So when we say there are three people who are God, we are saying something like that there are three distinct conscious beings who each share God's essential properties, such that they are unified by that same essence. They are one God in the sense that they are united by the same attributes, the same will, the same personality features of love and justice, and so on. Yet they are distinct persons in that they do not share the same subjective experience, can be in community with one another, and can interact amongst each other in a way that is not equivalent to you talking to yourself alone in a room.  Ultimately because the Trinity has no earthly analog it will always be something of a mystery. I think if we had examples of such a tripersonal being in our earthly experience it would not be so much of a paradox. I don't believe that the notion is logically incoherent but it can be difficult to apprehend due to a lack of analogs.

I'm a 17 year old guy who is trying to continue pursuing my relationship with Jesus but this addiction and struggle with porn keeps blocking me and making me stumble all the time. It's really serious, the enemy has been always putting this in my path. I really need prayer support from my fellow Christian brothers and sisters. There is also a godly girl at my youth group I'm interested in and we text pretty frequently but it makes me so sad sometimes whenever I give in to the temptation because of knowing that I have first grieved my Saviour and secondly, thinking of how she would feel if she knew. I really need Jesus to completely get rid of this, just out of my life completely. Just needed a place to express how I'm feeling on this issue. Thanks so much you guys, I really appreciate you all","The reason why porn has this addictive hold over you is because you don't have a biblical view of the naked body. Most churches don't either. But I also used to have the same view as you until I finally understood the naked body is NOT automatically a sexual one. For over ten years I was not able to break the cycle of lust. I continually put my face in the mud until I learned the better way from people who had already freed themselves from this  - Our culture classically conditioned you to think: naked = always erotic, [pavlov dogs classical conditioning - google.com](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=pavlov%20dogs%20classical%20conditioning). That is a lie  - This is the truth: naked body = god's image (at least in part. The other part is spirit)  This why women and men are beautiful when naked (at least some of the time ‚ò∫Ô∏é), because God is beautiful. In the same way the motion of rolling waves, sound of music, or the bodies of animals are non-sexually beautiful so is the human body. They are all a reflection of God's beauty. When you think and behave like this is true it will set you free. Temptation will be *substantially* minimized. For a lot of people porn is almost immediately removed from their life. You can look at the naked body and honor God instead of sinning against him. The site MyChainsAreGone.org helped me realize this and I highly recommend reading through it. The authors lay out the fundamental teachings of the Bible about the human body, its intended beauty, that'll free you. It's not very long. The core content is only about 50 book length pages       - Read this [Is there ANY Strategy Against Porn that REALLY Works? - mychainsaregone.org](http://mychainsaregone.org/is-there-any-strategy-against-porn-that-really-works)   - Then this [Start Here - mychainsaregone.org](http://mychainsaregone.org/start-here)  Some things you may be thinking about:    - It's very strong evidence that many cultures (ex. early Christian during baptisms) and many social situations (ex. modern hospitals) don't consider nakedness an automatically sexual situation. More details: [The Pornographic View of the Body - mychainsaregone.com](http://mychainsaregone.org/articles/pornographic-view)   - Common question, ""But what about nakedness and shame in the Bible?""

Better answer: read [The Biblical Shame of Nakedness - mychainsaregone.com](http://mychainsaregone.org/the-biblical-shame-of-nakedness/#) and [Nakedness in the OT - thebiblicalnaturist.com](http://thebiblicalnaturist.com/articles/Nakedness%20in%20the%20OT.pdf)   - Common question, ""But how are you sexually stimulated if not primarily with the body?"" Incomplete answer, relationally. It's the unification of both partners lives in every way. Instead of the impulse towards ""I want your body [while subtly counting everything else about the person as irrelevant]"" it's more like: ""I want to be unified with your life. I want all of you, not just the bodily you"". Better answer: read [Lie 2: Automatic Arousal - mychainsaregone.org](http://mychainsaregone.org/lies/lie-2/)   - Also, lust does not equal getting an erection.

Prostitution, adultery, rape, and all the rest still happen in societies where the naked body isn't sexualized, which is why God warns against coveting.

As someone who has been school for most of my life, I wonder what kinds of vocations I have the skills for that could complement ministry. Sometimes I wish there were professions which bivocational pastors took up together as a sort of co-op or denominational investment to provide secondary work and denominational revenue.   I have long been fascinated by monastic traditions of brewing beer which have served this function for many a monastic community, but what could *Presbyterians* do? It hit me today that Presbyterians would not brew beer, they would distill scotch style whiskey. Because of Presbyterian Scottish roots, there may be potential to use those connections to tap into the Scottish whiskey tradition. Aged whiskey is often a long term investment that can be highly profitable, as long as the quality is decent. Craft beer is a market that is in high demand, but that market is highly saturated with a multitude of micro-brewers. Scotch whiskey is also in high demand, but it is not an over-saturated market. Why not micro distilleries? Having ""Presbyterian Whiskey"" would be unique enough to get a certain degree of instant notoriety. With a bit of skill, luck, and the right Scottish connections, the PCUSA could make a long term investment which helps sustain the denomination and provide jobs to ministers/church leaders/congregants/etc.  I know that Scotch can only truly be Scotch if it is distilled in Scotland, but the Japanese distillery Suntory has made Scotch-style whiskey which is critically competitive with true Scottish-Scotch. This opens up credibility for non-Scottish Scotch style whiskey, and Presbyterians could make an special claim to authenticity from their Scottish roots. It may be a stretch, but there have been weaker claims which found marketable success.  I apologize if I have wasted your time is sharing this daydream. Anyone else think this would be cool? Anyone else think this would be *possible*?  TL;DR - This may be a silly day dream, but what if we made scotch-style ""Presbyterian Whiskey.""","Hey man--- do you have an idea of how you might build a community out of it?

I had always thought that there weren't any inherent risks in following the path of love, and that it was both the beautiful path and the beautiful destination, with nothing else needed.   I always thought that if I have faith in God and chant his name always, that will automatically bestow me with love and make me renunciate worldly things. I see Bhakti as the one solution.

Or to put it another way, what does it mean to be male/female (and other) outside of cultural descriptions?  *  How does gender apply to God?  *  Are we forever gendered or is there an androgynous goal ahead?    *  How do the genders relate in a way that is ""holy"" or ""Biblical""?  Both within marriage and in society in general.  *  Does gender dictate certain roles and functions?","* That question sort of broke my brain.   * I don't think it does, generally, other than Jesus referring to God as his Father, that and Jesus himself being male.  That's two out of three persons of the Trinity.   * Unknown, though if we are physically raised from the dead, then it stands to reason that we retain our identity.   *  I came back to this one.  I'm going to combine my answer with the last one, as I think they are kind of intertwined.  Maybe not completely, but I just woke up.  :) * I think, and this is just an opinion, that we are generally biologically inclined to sway towards certain things.  Neither traditional nor non-traditional gender roles are degrading.  Part of marriage is working as a team, playing off of each other's strengths in ways that complements each other.  Love God, love people, love each other like no other.  There isn't much room for superiority in that.  That, I think, is where holiness comes in, setting yourselves apart for the glory of God in a way that is pleasing to Him.  Maybe it's being married for going on 10 years that gives me the mindset that I have, but for me it is difficult to separate the topic at hand from marriage.","To most of those questions, I can only say, um, I Dunno. I'm afraid any answer I give would have to be prefaced with ""I speculate that..."" and that's not theology, it's just imagination.  But this one:  &gt; How does gender apply to God?    I think that needs two answers...  In the Incarnation, the Word became a human. Not just the idea of humanity, but a specific human being, with a nationality and a sex and all. Jesus Christ was a man. And, unless the Resurrection is completely ungendered, He still is.  But the Godhead - the divine nature and the three Persons - is not embodied, so biological sex isn't a category that applies. The pre-Abrahamic word El referred to a specifically male deity, and YHWH is likewise only ever referred to as ""he."" Asherah, El's consort, stubbornly keeps popping up until the Exile finally teaches the Jews monotheism - yet Asherah as an idea or character never merges with YHWH the way El does. It seems God was content to be called a *He* among the Hebrew people he was bringing into existence.   I can't imagine a possible theology that imputes sex to the Godhead, or even a nonphysical gender. And I'm fully aware that in creating and shaping the Hebrew nation out of Semitic raw material, God was working with people who had existing religious archetypes and gender roles - so I wouldn't try to read God's choice to be called a *He* as God's *being* in any meaningful sense male.  But I also tend to honor his choice. In a patriarchal culture, God chose to say in effect ""My relationship to you is in some ways like that of a father: a provider, an authoritarian, a soldier, an owner and buyer and seller, an offerer of sacrifices, and someone whose name and nature and property you inherit."" Because God has used almost exclusively masculine images and self-descriptions, I'm reluctant to consider re-envisioning God as Goddess.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.9694343926

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/hinduism.jsonl,hinduism.jsonl,o9szkc,"Karma Theory is a bit redundant I feel, and not what core Upanishads (Advaita) say..? Hear me out!","Hey guys! So this became long, but please read!!  So a philosophical question popped up in my mind in the amidst of reading the Upanishads and Shankara's commentaries on Advaita (non-duality)! I'd like to say I'm a Hindu (advaitin)! So I certainly don't want to offend if done so!  So generally, if you ask Hindus about suffering, many will explain how a certain bad event your currently facing at a certain moment is caused due to a past bad action you've done before (and maybe in a previous life). And they will also say once when the good karma (actions) and bad karma (actions) gets cancelled out, you'll get liberated (not all hindus may say this, but my dad has said it before a bit). Okay, but I personally never found this answer that convincing.  So, Advaita in general posits that suffering (Dukha) is created by the false view of the self and will only cease to exist when right self-knowledge (atma-vidya) is adopted. So, we constantly superimpose the concept of our 'self' or who ""I"" am on other transient objects (cars, houses, money), on people (our parents, husbands/wives), as though they are a part of ""I"" or the ""self"", such that when they get affected or cease to exist, we feel as though a part of us is taken away. Our well-being is always contingent on what happens to these various attachments of ours, which are never static and always ever changing/transient (maya). So the key is to realize this maya for what it is, and know this inner self to be all that's worth pursuing (when we get done with our responsibilities in life afcourse).  So, I always found this karma theory of suffering (about a certain bad event being cause by our past actions in previous lives) and the false view of the self version of why suffering occurs, totally contradictory? If the reason we actually suffer is cause of the attachment of our self on transient things (maya) instead on just our inner self (not even our body), then why does karma as a theory exist, and why do hindus talk about it almost mathamatically, like it's a law of a universe like gravity? Like, suffering the whole time was always contingent on the view of the ""Self"" we had, and on our false perception of it, not on the past actions that come back to you. I feel that advaita makes more logical sense. The karma theory as a principle is difficult to accept with logical certainty, it's seems unprovable, especially when it's approached as a 'universal underlying law of nature'. Perception (pratyaksa) and Inference (anumana) are both two imp sources of knowledge in hinduism (pramanas), so i think it makes sense! I'm still thinking how this effects rebirth and such, I'm still learning advaita and its ideas, so I'm not sure.  But, I feel Hindus should probably read the inner details of things like advaita, cause i feel the role of karma in most Hindus worldview is kinda overblown/overrated? I mean if one doesn't accept shankara's advaita, and is from another school, i guess I can see for karma and its uses. But I would like to know your opinions on this!","Just tell me what does ""Purnamadah purnamidam purnatpurnamuchyate , purnasya purnamadaya purnamevavasisyate"" means as per advaita ?","&gt;... **we constantly superimpose the concept of our 'self'** or who ""I"" am on other transient objects (cars, houses, money), on people (our parents, husbands/wives), as though they are a part of ""I"" or the ""self"", such that **when they get affected or cease to exist**, we feel as though a part of us is taken away.

I'd post this to r/spirituality but they just give condescending answers like ""suffering doesn't exist, think positive thoughts they will banish your very real problems blah blah"". This seems like the place to post because I do believe in God and feels like I could get some good answers. Have you ever felt like God hates you, because of the horribly painful things that happen in life? Like he doesn't care? How do you regain the connection to God when it feels like he's shutting you out? I do get signs like seeing 11:11 on the clock or similar crazy coincidences. So I guess he's listening? Or is all this in my head? Anyway.. the facts of my life are making it very hard to live happily, I won't go into the details but it's one horrible thing after another. How to cope? Why do you think God would punish me?","I think for you, the issue may be ‚Äúwhat brings you hope?‚Äù    Believing that God hates you isn‚Äôt going to bring you to Him.    Being all ‚ÄúGod takes care of all things‚Äù just to sound all sparrow and green meadows, doesn‚Äôt fit in a world with evil and free will.  There is always an other side of things.  All physical things must end.  It may be a factor of seeing what you can control and alter and doing whatever tiny bit you can to change one factor at a time until eventually you are where you want to be.    I hope this helps.","Well since you're posting to a christian sub, I'll respond with a christian answer and maybe it will help you.   I don't think God is punishing you. And I don't think seeing signs like 11:11 are proof of God (unless these are specific signs that you asked for). The trials and tribulations of our lives are the result of nature. God will very rarely prevent something in nature from happening because he values working through *us* rather than through direct miracles. So... bad things happen. And they happen equally to everyone. What these situations can do, however, is teach us, mold us, and make us grow in ways we couldn't have otherwise. In that way, God uses the bad things that happen to us in order to glorify us. I don't know how you'll grow through the difficulties you face.   But perhaps God allowed these things to happen so that you would turn here to this subreddit and learn more about the love of Christ.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.2681845147

There are still a lot of things in Mormon history I am unaware of.   Had you previously seen the phrase ""United Firm"" used?  A google search yields mostly results from the Church website and BYU.  The context of the Come Follow Me lesson seems to attempt to limit the scope of the United Order in Kirtland to a few businesses under the umbrella of one ""firm"" or business.   My understanding of the United Order in Kirtland is that it was an attempt at New Testament, utopian communal living.  In short, that it was comprehensive.  I recognize that the United Order in Utah was a little different (and was different from town to town even).

This iteration of the universe was said to begin again with a Big Bang. Maybe the expansion, but all the material was there prior to that. It was condensed. I'll say the true starting point was God.

I shall refer to D&amp;C 74 In that chapter we are told that the Law of Moses was fulfilled through Christ's atonement. Leviticus 18 is often times cited as the reason we believe homosexuality to be a sin. But Levitcus is litterly an entire book of laws. All of the laws and commandments that come from the Old Testament should be disregarded and replaced with the teachings of Christ because he fulfilled the Law of Moses. To say anything otherwise would be open denial of scripture and not just this revelation to Joseph Smith, Jr.   In D&amp;C 74 3-5 the Lord describes a scenario in which an apostle knowingly enforces the Law of Moses. Christ fulfilled the Law of Moses . If you've not looked it up yet, please do.   Now, Romans 1 is the argument I hear back. This is a letter written by Paul. It is literally the only time homosexuality is discussed in the New Testament. Some argue that this ""revelation"" is more current, after the time of Christ, but it is exactly the action discribed in D&amp;C 74. It isn't a ""revelation"" at all, instead they are mere words of a man clinging to old laws. Jesus never mentioned homosexuality. Nephi never addressed it. Nor did Samual see fit to even mention it once. And Joseph Smith never wrote about and if the Lord gave revelation to Smith concerning homosexuality, it has yet to be revealed to us.   So, why do we not reject the old law, as commanded, and embrace the new law, love god and your neighbor, and extend love and salvation to all of God's children?","The church hates gays and references their books when it's convenient, ignores them when it's inconvenient or contradictory.   There's no consistency.","I'd say there's some consistency. Women and black members have seen progress in the church as social pressure, culture, and the views of top leadership have changed. It doesn't really matter whether a view is backed up by scripture or revelation, if it's been in practice for a while it's going to take a while to work itself out.

This will also be a long post so again I apologise, but appreciate those who take the time to read it.  To provide some background I am 23 Y/O male, I have ADHD, Aspergers(ASD) and I would say I am doing well my common standards, I am getting married later this year, I have my own home, a gorgeous puppy, a nice new car and for my age a well paying job with lots of opportunities to grow and move upwards. Everything external to me is going great, I am happy and content with my lot, the internal is where it gets messy.  For anyone with ADHD/Aspergers I am sure you can relate to the feeling of not belonging, through constant bullying or discrimination growing up to people never understanding how or why your mind works the way it does, to the inability to stick to something or seeing something through to the end, I have always struggled with having a place or a thing to feel welcome in (other than my mother and my now fianc√©e) I still do not have that, and when they are not around I feel vulnerable and anxious.  So I turned to religion/philosophy/ways of life, whatever you may call it, I‚Äôve looked at a lot - Christianity (even impulsively getting baptised), Hinduism, Buddhism, Stoicism, Taoism, Norse Paganism, just regular old living, Confucianism etc, but I like a lot of aspects from a lot of these ways of life, naturally they overlap but also contradict so I can never find myself settling, I never rest or feel at home, this also relates back to my inability to stick something out, to get into the swing of it and see what it can offer outside of a week/s or month/s, I love so many different parts, like meditation, wu Wei, indifference, living in accordance with nature etc.  I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I‚Äôm looking for by posting this, I just wanted to rant, see if anyone has similar stories or even any advice people want to give, I love all walks of life and have huge respect for them, but what was it that solidified your commitment to a certain one or certain   I feel incredibly lost, unable to settle in one place, to commit to something, but do I need to settle, so I have to find a place to call home etc?  Sorry for the rant.  TL/DR: I struggle to find a place to call ‚Äúhome‚Äù, so I really need one or can I enjoy multiple ‚Äúhouses‚Äù.","I have a simple solution for u. Do ""anulom Vilom"".

Best wishes to u. many thanks for listening","This hit very close as I spent most of my 20's and part of my 30's in the mode you are describing your internal life. Things have gotten better as I have become older and they keep getting better but I still have days where I get into that zone.    While it's fine to enjoy multiple houses for a while, over time such non-committal existence becomes exhausting. You can replace the word ""house"" with ""spouse"" and obtain the same result.   In my experience, the commitment occurs naturally over time. All the paths you mention have similarities - in particular in their ethical aspects. So even if you are jumping from one to the other, you are, on average, moving in the right direction. That's not to say that they are all the same: it's just that the paths don't diverge until much later.   Things that helped me were:   1. Be ethical in speech and conduct. Treat people with kindness and concern.   2. Engage with the world around you. The world includes the physical, the biological, the ecological, the social, the economic and the political. Be inquisitive about all of them, be informed and participate fully but don't lose yourself in any of them. Detached engagement is important.   3. Concern yourself only with what makes a practical difference. Avoid pointless theoretical and academic debates, avoid questions that simply can't be answered with available evidence and, avoid pointless speculations. 4. Speak in concrete and precise terms. Use clear unambiguous language at all times and make sure that every word has a clear referent.  Relentless practice of this will force you to have clear thoughts. You will immediately be able to spot if your thoughts are muddy and if you need to seek out additional knowledge.  Over time, nonsensical ideas will fall away and clarity of thought will emerge, and with that, clear direction and thence peace. Orwell's essay ""Politics and the English language"" was a great influence for me.  5. Develop gratitude both for the things that you have and the things that you lack.  The latter might be strange, especially for those who may have traumatic experiences or have severe deprivation. I definitely am not advocating pacifist or defeatist acceptance of shortcomings or oppression but peace comes from coming to terms with them and seeing opportunity in them.  6. Integrate yourself. Much of my restlessness was lack of alignment between my inherent nature, my personal goals, my professional goals, my social goals and my spiritual goals.  These slowly came into alignment over time, either by themselves or through some actions of mine. But as this alignment occurred, things got better.   Best wishes!",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.5735820719

The Beast spoken about in the bible is a system, a satanic organization. These people are called ""33rd degree  Freemasons"" and they control the whole world, all of the religions, the media, news, music, movies, history, and the mainstream narrative. Freemasonry is an ancient cult.  The god of Freemasonry is literally Satan from the Bible. The richest people in the world literally worship Satan. Covid-19 is a global plan. The collapse of the global economy is part of that plan. They want to create a new world order (hence new normal said by everyone) [https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/) (Event 201 was held on October 18th 2019), a world society, each person marked and  controllable. The vaccine contains a gene editing technology called Crispr, to change your DNA. You will never be the same after taking it and it is irreversible. It also contains nanotechnology  [https://patents.google.com/patent/US9539210B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9539210B2)  to connect humans to the Internet and control them. This is called ""Neural Link"" mind control, using A.I. (artificial intelligence) supercomputer technology. It will give them ultimate power over  people. To kill them or to control them. That is why they are installing 5G towers all over the world at a rapid rate. 5G speed is necessary to successfully control millions of people. They will  turn them on when more people are vaccinated. BIBLICAL PROPHECY. The vaccine also contains a chemical enzyme called Luciferase, which is taken from fireflies to make you scannable, so they  can see who has taken the mark of the beast vaccine! They are creating the race of Lucifer. It even has Lucifer‚Äôs name in it! Anyone who takes this vaccine will go to hell on Judgment Day  according to the Bible. Revelation 19 : 20 ""And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who wrought miracles in his presence, by which he DECEIVED them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These BOTH were cast alive into a lake of fire, burning with brimstone."" They even called this thing ""Microsoft Patent # 060606""! 0 is a non number. They will soon label people who don‚Äôt want to take the vaccine as ""Terrorists"". Be strong, this is only the beginning!  \-&gt; Revelation 13 : 16-18. (16) And they cause all, young and old, rich and poor, free and prisoner, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead (17) And that no one can buy or sell  without having received the mark of the beast, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name \[all of these mean taking the vaccine!\] And that eventually all should be killed who refuse.  &amp;#x200B;  (18) Here is wisdom: Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and its number is 666.  &amp;#x200B;  \- The book of Revelation was created from a dream that John received from ê§Ñê§âê§Ñê§Ä (Ahayah = I AM) The Most High God. The details of visions and dreams have metaphorical interpretations,  not literal interpretations! Forehead = thoughts. Name = authority / purpose. The Number of a man = mankind's patent number system. Its number is 666 = Microsoft Patent # 060606. The Greek  word for what has been translated as ""mark"" is khar'-ag-mah, and it means a scratch or etching, something that pierces the skin! A VACCINE. The mark is literal. The location of the mark is  not literal, its METAPHORICAL. Right hand = being able to work since almost everyone on earth is right handed (only 10 percent of all people are left handed), earn and spend money. The vaccine is administered to your arm, not your hand, but it affects your right hand and forehead, so to speak. The  vaccine will soon be mandatory. You will have to take the vaccine to join the new system they are creating. That is why Microsoft and other software companies are involved in this vaccine. It  is not a vaccine. Bill Gates is not a doctor and Microsoft is not a medical company, it‚Äôs a software company! This vaccine contains software to introduce a Global ‚ÄúBiometrics-enabled Digital  Cryptocurrency System‚Äù. This is a new system of money that will soon be implemented after they get rid of cash money. They will blame cash for spreading Covid-19. \*\*\*\*\* WATCH! \*\*\*\*\*  &amp;#x200B;  The third angel is also metaphorical. It represents people like me who are warning you right now.  &amp;#x200B;  It precepts with Daniel 11:33 and 12:10, which say ‚Äúthe wise among them will understand and shall instruct many, but the wicked will not understand.‚Äù  \-&gt; Revelation 14 : 9-11. (9) And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, ""If anyone worships the beast (freemason/illuminati) and their image, and receives their mark in his hand  or in his forehead, (10) he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out unmixed into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of Christ: (11) The smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and their  &amp;#x200B;  image, and receive the mark of their name.  &amp;#x200B;  \-&gt; Worship = submit to. \[receiving the technology in their vaccine\]. Image = Supercomputing Artificial Intelligence System. Name = authority / purpose. Satan's purpose is to get people to be  sent to hell on the day of judgment. Instead of influencing you to live a life of sin, they now have a new way to get people to be damned to hell forever by God. All they have to do now is get  you to take the mark. They want everyone to take the vaccine. Satan knows that he is going to be sent to hell, and he wants to take you with him!

Conclusion: they want to connect  us to the artificial intelligence supercomputer system so they can control us, and they want to change our DNA! This is why people do not repent during the plagues that God will soon send to  the earth. This is said in Revelation 9:20. (20) And the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of their sins. -&gt; They are under mind control. Most people's  thoughts are already controlled by demons, this technology will make it permanent. They will use marked people to try to convince unmarked people to receive the mark! They will eventually  make marked people to hunt down and kill unmarked people when they activate the Neural Link between the supercomputer and the marked people through 5G. Revelation 13:15. (15) And they  had power to give life to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast could both speak and cause that anyone who would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.  Artificial Intelligence System = The Image Of The Beast. Submitting to them and taking the mark of the beast vaccine = worshipping the image of the beast = Connecting people to the System.  Mind control. This is also how they get all of these marked people to fight Christ when He returns. Revelation 17:14, Joel 3, and Revelation 19:19-21 tell you about that. Revelation 19:19.  (19) And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Christ. Revelation 19:20 tells you that people will be deceived into taking the mark  of the beast. Revelation 19:20. (20) And the beast (the secret societies that control the world) was taken away, and with him the false prophet (the false prophet represents the churches that  tell people to take the vaccine!) who deceived people into receiving the mark of the beast, and they were cast into the lake of fire, hell. -&gt; People took the vaccine because they were deceived  and did not know that it was the mark of the beast. Revelation 19:21. (21) And the remnant of mankind that kept not the laws of God, or that had the mark of the beast, were killed by Christ,  and all the fowls of the air were filled with their flesh. Matthew 24:37. (37) But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of Christ be. Matthew 24:22. (22) And if those days are not  shortened, no flesh shall be saved. -&gt; If you do some research, you will find that there were many scientific experiments conducted by the fallen angels before the flood, in the time of Noah.  Genetic modification! -&gt; If you search for the Hebrew words that have been translated, the word for flesh = human genetic code. saved = preserved! What Matthew 24:22 really says is this:  ¬´ if Christ does not return sooner rather than later, all humans who are still alive at that time will have genetic codes that have been altered, there will be no original humans left ¬ª  \- -&gt; The hybrid-children of the fallen angels (they had kids with women) are the ones in power and they want to give us their genetic code. Creation of zombies / robots. There is a reason they  have been showing this in all of their Hollywood movies. Predictive programming. Once you've injected this stuff into you, you'll never be the same again. Whoever takes the mark of the beast  will be sent to hell on the day of judgment when God judges us. Here is what the Bible says about people who put their trust in the satanic weaponized vaccine that Satan's people have created  instead of God. \[Romans 6:16\] Don't you know that by surrendering yourselves to someone as slaves to obey him, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin that leads to damnation, or  of obedience that leads to salvation? \[1 Corinthians 3:16\] Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? \[Mark 12:17\] And Christ said to them,  ""Render to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."" \[1 Corinthians 6:19-20\] Don‚Äôt you know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit within you which you have received  from God? Therefore honor God with your bodies. \[1 Timothy 6:20\] O Timothy, guard what is entrusted to your trust, avoiding profane and vain talk, and the oppositions of science falsely called  so. \[1 Corinthians 3:17\] If anyone defiles their Temple of God, God will destroy him. This is what will happen to anyone who takes this technology / weapon / mark of the beast / vaccine.  \- In Genesis, God said that the plants he made were for the healing of the nations. Is that true or not? Who will you serve? The Satanic elites, in their news articles and websites on the  Internet, are calling the Covid-19 vaccine ""THE MESSIAH"", and ""OUR ONLY HOPE"". They like to make fun of Christ and they like to make fun of people. They know that whoever takes this  vaccine will be damned forever. They are celebrating this great sacrifice of souls to Satan their God. Did you know that all vaccines contain aborted fetal cells and pork gell and other strange  things? ABOMINATION. Have you ever heard the saying ‚ÄúYou are what you eat."" It is even worse to inject it into you. Do you really want to inject that into your bloodstream? Disgusting!  \- - -&gt; -&gt;&gt; This Covid-19 vaccine is unlike any other vaccine ever created. This is actually a software update for humans. As if we were computers. The Covid Tests also have nano-particles  on it. Don't believe the people on TV, they have an agenda! They are paid readers, reading from a script! A lot of people have actually DIED from taking the vaccine! They are trying to hide this  fact from us. The Freemasons own the news stations all over the world. They control the dominant narrative. The groups that have controlled the world for hundreds of years and thousands of  years are ‚ÄúThe Illuminati‚Äù, The Rosicrucians, The Knights Templar, The Skull and Bones Society, The Jesuits, Freemasonry, Zionists, The Order of the Dragon. These extremely powerful  organizations control the whole world, working for the devil! How do they do it? They have put people in key positions in every government, organization, corporation, and church system.  \- - - -&gt;- -&gt; -&gt;&gt;&gt; There are many false teachings about the end times that the Jesuit Order has deceived the whole world into believing. They control the Christian Church and its teachings!  They control all religions, especially Christianity, because they know that the power is in the word of God. These religions have nothing to do with the Bible. It‚Äôs not a religion. It is a history book  of the Israelites! Most of the black and brown people of this world are the true Israelites! White people are not Israelites. The people in Israel today are imposters. They form some of the main  illuminati families. Christ calls them ‚Äúthe synagogue of Satan, they which say they are jews and are not‚Äù in Revelation 2:9, and in Revelation 3:9 he says ‚ÄúListen, I will force those who belong to  Satan's synagogue -those liars who call themselves Jews but are not Jews- to come and worship at your feet, and they will know that you are the ones I love.‚Äù Watch Yarashalam on YouTube!  \-&gt; We are living these last years before the return of Yashaya / Christ. Sadly, most people are waiting for an individual antichrist man to rule the whole world. This will never happen. The  antichrist is not an individual man! -&gt; Here is a list of the false end-times teachings that the Jesuit Order has deceived the whole world into believing, through modern Christianity:  | # 1- The antichrist is an individual man. | # 2- There will be a third temple built in Israel. | # 3- The antichrist will call himself God in the temple in Israel. | # 4- The antichrist will end the daily  sacrifice in the temple in Israel. | # 5- The antichrist will send an image of himself to every country on earth to be worshipped. | # 6- There will be two witnesses in Israel sent from heaven,  Elijah and Moses. | # 7- There will be a ""rapture‚Äù / supernatural removal of people into the sky and we will not be here for the great tribulation. \[\[\[\[\[ THESE THINGS ARE ALL LIES ! \]\]\]\]\] They  teach this garbage so that people won't realize what time it is, because they think that as long as one man isn‚Äôt ruling the whole earth, or because we are still here, it's not the end times yet!  \--&gt; Here is the truth: | # 1- There are many antichrists, not one. The antichrist is the fourth beast in the book of Daniel. It is a system. Not an individual man. The antichrist is the  Freemasons, ""The Illuminati"". 1 John 2:18. Look up the greek words translated as ‚Äúman‚Äù and ‚Äúson‚Äù in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, The ‚Äúman of sin‚Äù and ‚Äúson of perdition‚Äù is speaking of PLURAL people  NOT AN INDIVIDUAL = huge deception so that you won‚Äôt suspect them | # 2- The temple mentioned in the book of Daniel and the book of Revelation is talking about our bodies, not a physical  building in Israel. 1 Corinthians 3:16 | # 3- The mark of the beast technology in the vaccine will destroy your connection with God and change the DNA of your temple. Here is what's inside:  Crispr DNA modification technology, V-MAT2 gene inhibitor technology, and nano bots / nanotechnologies for the purpose of mental manipulation through ""voice to skull technology"" and ""Neural  Link"". Research ‚ÄúNeural Link Agenda‚Äù! It literally talks about it in Daniel 11:36 and 2 Thessalonians 2:4. It is talking about supercomputers, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology being put  inside of human being‚Äôs bodies, not a literal king sitting in a temple somewhere. This technology will become god over your body once it is administered. That's why the Bible says that these  scriptures were sealed until the end. Daniel 12:4 says: Daniel, seal the book, even until the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. Daniel did not even  understand what he was seeing at that time. It wasn‚Äôt understandable until now! | # 4- The daily sacrifice is food. The Old Testament tells you that. Only those who defile their temples will be  able to buy and sell in Satan's system. Daniel 9:27. Daniel 12:11-12 tells you that Christ will return 1,335 days after a law has been passed forbidding the entry into stores without the vaccine.  | # 5- The Hebrew words translated as ""the image"" actually means the objective / purpose, and the word ""worship"" actually means submit to. By taking the vaccine, you are submitting to the  objective and purpose of the beast system which is to change your DNA and connect you to the image. The image = the artificial intelligence supercomputer internet control system that they  want to connect people to. The mark connects you to it through nanotechnology. (Taking the mark, the name, or the number of the beast, it all means the same thing. The meaning of these  things is the act of taking the vaccine, and taking the vaccine is what it means to worship and submit to the image of the beast). All those who do this will go to hell on Judgment Day! Keep in  mind, the people who receive this technology will not be instantly connected to A.I., but all of the required technology has been installed in order to activate the Neural Link later on. On top of  that, these nanobots are actually self-replicating, so they will literally create a swarm within the host‚Äôs body. The Crispr gene-modification technology, on the other hand, will cause changes  immediately upon being injected. This technology is so drastic that MANY people have died within one day after receiving the vaccine! | # 6- The two witnesses are the two kingdoms of Israel,  which separated into two after the sin of King Solomon. It tells you about that in 1 Kings 11 and 1 Kings 12 and 2 Chronicles 10. They are called the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern  &amp;#x200B;  kingdom (Judah). The Native people from North, Central, and South America, the Polynesians, Melanesians and the Aborigines of Australia = The 10 Northern Kingdom Tribes of Israel who left  Israel by the Euphrates River in 720 B.C. to go to distant lands where no mankind lived and worship their God and keep his laws in peace. 2 Ezra 13:40-46 tells you that. That‚Äôs why they took  14 books out of the Bible one hundred and fifty years ago! Google it! Those books tell you about these things! They want to hide this stuff for the purposes of white supremacy and the fake  saved-by-grace lawless christianity. | # 7- Christ returns once more, not twice. We have to go through the great tribulation. Christ comes at the 7th trumpet, not before. Matthew 24: 29-30.  \-----&gt;- -&gt;- -&gt; -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember, the mainstream news and websites, radio stations and the television are all controlled by the Satanists (""Freemasons"") who control the entire world. You  have to find the truth. You have to research. Use the keywords I gave you. Don‚Äôt listen to them. They want your soul. If you do your research, you will find that all of the people in key positions  of power are related to Freemasonry. They are corrupt. They have an agenda. I didn't even believe in the Bible until I learned these things. A small group of people control the whole world and  literally believe in Satan from the Bible! And that they have been in power for thousands of years. The Amalekite, Edomite and Canaanite royal bloodlines! This is their kingdom, and their time is  almost up and they know it. Christ is coming back in a few years. The Freemasons are the real government, they have controlled every government for thousands of years. Secret societies. If  you have no idea what I'm talking about, just Google ""Freemasons"". A picture is worth a thousand words! A picture is worth more than a thousand words! Also look up ""nano bots"" on Google  images. That is what is inside of the vaccine! YES. They literally planned out a lot of the final details of the Covid-19 plan at a meeting called ""Event 201"" in October 2019, a month before the  Covid Agenda began in China, and there is footage of the meeting online! Search ""Event 201 is Agenda 21, the new world order agenda exposed"". The covid-19 death toll is exaggerated by the  media. Many people simply had the common yearly flu but were diagnosed with Covid! PCR tests do not really test for Covid. In Africa, Tanzanian President John Magufuli tested fruits, a goat,  and motor oil for Covid-19 and all gave positive test results! Among the people who were actually sick, many people became sick as a result of 5G towers being set up, for example in Wuhan  China. It had a massive rollout of thousands of 5G cell towers in October 2019. 5G towers emit extremely high levels of radiation and cause the red blood cells in your body to explode like a  microwave, depleting your body of oxygen. These are the same symptoms as Covid. Also, all of the deaths that occur in the hospitals are being called Covid, even if someone died from cancer  or old age. The insurance companies and government are paying hospitals $13,000 per ""case"". Also, many people were put on ventilators, when they shouldn‚Äôt have been, and these ventilators  collapsed their lungs. Others were put on morphine drips which shut down all of their organs and killed them. And then they harvested their organs and sold them. Big Business Big Money $ $ $  It is INCENTIVISED MURDER -&gt; This is why they say there is no Covid-19 in small places like the Cook Islands. It's too difficult to tell their lies there. The community is too small to deceive.  \----&gt;- -&gt;- -&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to smoke marijuana and drink alcohol, but I quit forever when I learned the information contained on this piece of paper. That was 4 years ago! I‚Äôm too afraid of God  and the day of judgment. Obviously, God exists. Repent of your sins and take these things seriously. We must keep the 10 Commandments. We must keep the Sabbath day set apart, no  physical work, earning or spending money, cooking, exercising, walking long distances, driving, using machines, watching worldly entertainment, Facebook, watching television, etc. We must  stop breaking the dietary laws in the book of Leviticus, chapter 11. We are not supposed to eat pork, shrimp, crab, lobster or shellfish. We have to stop smoking cigarettes and marijuana and  drugs and drinking alcohol, and no more pornography or masturbation. Read Revelation 21:8 The word sorcery means anything that changes your mental state, including marijuana &amp; cigarettes.  \---&gt; -&gt;&gt; Christianity no longer has anything in common with Christ and the disciples. They‚Äôre not teaching the true doctrine of Christ today. The Roman‚Äôs created modern christianity in 325  A.D. using false interpretations of Paul‚Äôs letters to teach you that you don‚Äôt have to keep God‚Äôs laws anymore! In order to be saved from hell on Judgment Day, you must be completely  dedicated to keeping God's laws. Matthew 24:13 &amp; Matthew 7:21-23 tell you this. The true doctrine of Christ can be easily seen (probably for the first time in your life because all churches  teach lies based on the false interpretation of Paul's letters) by looking at these Bible verses and connecting them all together in this order. Write them in this order and look at them it‚Äôs beautiful  Isaiah 28: 9-10 + Psalms 119:100 + Psalms 111:10 + Psalms 119:104 + Matthew 15:9 + Isaiah 34:16 + Proverbs 8:17 + 1 John 5:3 + 1 John 3:8 + 1 John 3:4 + 1 John 2:4 + Psalms 119:142 +  John 3:16-21 + Proverbs 6:23 + Psalms 119:165 + Proverbs 28:9 + Matthew 7:21-23 + Matthew 24:13 + Philippians 2:12 + John 14:15. This is what they say: Whom shall he teach knowledge?  and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line  upon line; here a little, and there a little: I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow His precepts gain  rich understanding. Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men. Seek ye out of the book of  the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate -&gt; I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. God only loves those who love Him. He hates  almost everyone on earth. You‚Äôve been deceived. Loving God = For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. He that continues in  sin belongs to the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. What is sin? Sin is transgression of God‚Äôs commandments. If any man says he knows God and does not keep God‚Äôs  commandments, he is a liar and The Truth is not in him. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and thy law is the truth. This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world  but men loved darkness rather than Light. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life. Great peace have they which love thy law: and  nothing shall offend them. He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination! Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of  heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  If ye love me, keep my commandments. Christ is a black man. And the true doctrine of Christ, compared to what is taught today, is as different as a white man and a black man. We are told  that God's laws are done away with and that it doesn‚Äôt matter who the real Israelites are. The doctrine of Christ is very simple. Go and sin no more. Stop breaking God's laws. Cesare Borgia is  the man whose portrait they created the fake white jesus image from. Google Cesare Borgia if you don't know what I'm talking about! He was the son of the governor of Italy and in 1507 they  hired Leonardo da Vinci to paint the Modern Image of Jesus to promote white supremacy in the world through the cult of modern pagan false Christianity, and they used Cesare as a model for  the painting, which they then sent to the four corners of the earth, and began to promote. The image of Jesus that people believe in is a portrait of Cesare Borgia! The whole world worships a  fake white jesus from the deceptions of the satanic Catholic Church. The real Christ is not a homosexual hippie who loves everyone, he is a black tribal warrior king and he wouldn't even want  people to worship his image! This violates the second commandment of idol worship! We are to worship God, not Christ, and we worship God by keeping His commandments, not bowing down  to an image or statue! 1 John 5:3 tells you this! Google search ""Russian Catacombs Israelites"" to see ancient paintings of the BLACK Israelites. The black people in America are from the tribe  of Judah. Like Christ. Israelites are at the bottom today because of some of their ancestors not keeping God‚Äôs commandments. Deuteronomy 28:15 tells you that. Galatians 3:28 does not  mean that everyone is equal. It‚Äôs one body, but the body parts aren‚Äôt equal. Deuteronomy 28:13 tells you that. It‚Äôs going to be an Israelite kingdom. In Christ‚Äôs kingdom, Non-Israelites will be  the servants of Israelites, in righteousness! Isaiah 14:2 tells you that. The Israelites who are accepted into the kingdom of Christ will be the rulers of the kingdom. That is why Christ is called  the King of Kings, because there will be many kings in His kingdom! The Israelites will be at the top and not at the bottom! If you want a basic understanding of who the true Israelites are, you  can do a Google image search for ""12 Tribes Chart"", Type: 12 Tribes Chart. The powers that be do not want people to keep God's commandments, especially not the Israelites, because they  stay in power by keeping people in sin, especially the Israelites. When the Israelites come back to keeping God‚Äôs commandments, they will rule the world again. All of Deuteronomy chapter 28  tells you that. It is prophesied that this will begin to happen at the end before Christ comes back. Ezekiel 37 tells you that. THAT TIME IS RIGHT NOW! -&gt; The Freemasons want to stop the  awakening and keep people in religion. They know who the true Israelites are, and they know that they will lose all of their power now that the Israelites are waking up and keeping their God‚Äôs  laws again. Deuteronomy 28:1 tells you that there can only be one nation that rules the whole world, and if the Israelites keep the laws of God, then He will make sure that they are the rulers of  the whole world. The Freemasons want to stop that from happening. That is why the end times tribulation is also called ‚ÄúJacob‚Äôs Trouble‚Äù in the Bible. Jeremiah 30:7 tells you that. They want  to mark, or kill, all of the Israelites before Christ comes back so that he won‚Äôt have a people to come back for. Christ is going to defeat the beast system and bring his people back to their land.  Israel. Jacob is the father of the 12 tribes of Israel. God changed Jacob's name to Israel. This is why the tribes of His sons are called Israelites. God gave His laws to the Israelites through  Moses. The Bible is not a religion, religion is a sin. God said to keep His laws not to be a religion. They are all teaching false doctrines. The secret societies that control this world want  everyone to be damned by God on Judgment Day. That's what their god wants. They achieve this by encouraging people to live and die in their sins. This is why the Freemasons control the  music industry, Hollywood, schools, and every other form of influence, including religion. They actually use religion to teach you that you don't have to follow God's laws, that you can be saved  on the day of judgment by faith and grace and by being a good person or by being religious. LIES. Revelation 12:9. (9) And there was cast out the great dragon, that old serpent called the devil,  and Satan, which deceiveth the whole earth: and he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. What do you think Area 51 is for? Deep underground military bases.  That‚Äôs where they talk to their gods.That‚Äôs where they are. Read Enoch. The scriptures say that Satan deceives the whole world. Where is Satan? Do you see him? No. So the Bible is lying? No.  \-&gt; -&gt;&gt; If you don't understand that rich satanic royal bloodlines rule the world, and you don't know who the real Israelites are, then you can't understand the Bible and how it applies to us  today. You will be completely ignorant. You will be what we call in the truth movement ‚Äúasleep‚Äù. It is time to wake up. Satan is not down here personally deceiving people, his people are doing it.  Do you understand? Satan only has an effect on people‚Äôs thoughts (through frequency manipulation, it‚Äôs how spirits effect people), he is not here with a physical body. He is not here literally  talking to people or deceiving or trapping them, his people are doing it for him. You have to wake up from The Matrix. He has deceived the whole world through the secret societies that have  served him and the fallen angels from the beginning. All religions pay homage to them, not to the creator. -&gt; Do not think that Christianity is an exception to this. They 100% control christianity  and all other religions, both those who read the Bible and those who do not. They tell you that you can be saved on Judgement Day without keeping God's commandments. They teach you to  ‚Äújust believe in Jesus‚Äù. That doesn‚Äôt even mean anything. The foundation of Christianity is the misinterpretation of Paul's letters. Paul's letters are a test by God to see if you will keep God's  laws. Paul's writings are very hard to understand. 2nd Peter 3:15-17 tells you not to even read Paul's letters! What Paul is really saying is that because we have all sinned at least once, we  don't deserve heaven. He‚Äôs not saying that we don't have to keep God's laws. Christ said that if you do not keep His Father's laws, you will not be saved on the day of judgment. It does not  matter how much you believe in Jesus. That means nothing to God. You must keep God's commandments. Christ said GO AND SIN NO MORE. John 5:14. Christ also said that if you don't  give up all of your sins you will go to hell. Matthew 24:13. Satan wants to make sin acceptable. The definition of sin is breaking God‚Äôs laws. It tells you that in 1 John 3:4. Satan wants people  to be atheists. And if he can't achieve that, he wants them to be stuck in religion! All of these religions are controlled by the Freemasons who worship Satan and they use these religions to  lower God's standard and make excuses for sin, and tell you that you‚Äôre saved by grace and that all you have to do is believe in Jesus. This is an absolute lie taught by Satan through his  ministers. He loves sin. He wants you to sin. He wants you to be a Christian. He wants you to be an atheist. Get it? Not complicated. There Will Be A Resurrection And We Will All Be Judged  \-&gt;- -&gt;- -&gt;&gt;&gt; When it comes to atheists, I don‚Äôt blame them, at least they‚Äôre not silly pagan christians! I was an atheist. Until I learned these things. Now I keep God's commandments.  \-&gt;- -&gt;- -&gt; -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The war has always been between God and Satan. Legality against anarchy. Keeping God's laws versus breaking God's laws. We can only be saved if we abandon all sin  in our lives. That‚Äôs what Christ said in Matthew 7:21-23. Satan is the prosecuting attorney and Christ is the defense attorney. On the day of judgment we are going to stand before God the  judge and Satan is going to accuse all of us of deserving to be sent to hell like him because we sinned many times in our life on purpose, just like him. He will say that we deserve the same  punishment. It‚Äôs up to Christ if He wants to defend us. He‚Äôs only going to defend us if we pay him his legal fees. His demand or his legal fees is that we keep his Father's commandments!  \-&gt; -&gt; -&gt; -&gt; -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have never read the scriptures for yourself and don't know what they say, I will summarize it briefly for you. Human beings were created by God to judge  rebellious angels and their leader, Satan. Satan and the fallen angels created a poisonous tree whose fruit acted as a genetic weapon to make those who ate it more fleshly, more sinful. Since  then, humanity has been rebelling against God with the fallen angels. God chose the only nation that did not deal with the fallen angels, the Hebrew Israelites, to be His people. He gave them  His laws. They are now being punished because some of them did not keep God's laws. No other nation is being punished for breaking God's laws, because He never made a covenant with  them. They are expected to live a sinful life and go to hell. The only way for each one of us to be saved from hell, whether we are Israelites or not (like me), is to keep God's laws. Christ will  soon return to restore His people. There will be a resurrection of all those who have lived and then God will judge everyone. The people who have kept the laws of God will live in the kingdom of  Christ &amp; the Israelites, and all of the people who have not kept God‚Äôs laws will be sent to the lake of fire with the fallen angels. It is by keeping God‚Äôs laws that we can distance ourselves from  the rebellion of the fallen angels and not be counted among their numbers. It is not too late to change. Ezekiel 18:24-28: When the wicked man turns from his wickedness he has committed  and does what is lawful and right, he will save his soul alive. If he thinks and turns away from all the transgressions he has committed, he will live, he will not die. But if the righteous man turns  away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, shall he live? All the righteousness which he hath done shall not be mentioned; and in his sin he shall die. God regards sin as spiritual death.  The Bible isn‚Äôt talking about death in these scriptures. It‚Äôs talking about being sent to hell forever on Judgment Day. Change your habits today!

These are my thoughts now after many days and weeks of consideration and thought.","My God is not the same as your God. My understanding and interpretations of Jesus Christ's teachings and messages are different than yours.  I believe in evolution, quantum theory, human psychology, and advanced other scientific theories.  I believe in MY God, MY religion.  NOT Christianity, NOT Atheism, MY beliefs.  MINE.  I guess you could say it's a philosophy and a religious belief. I follow some Christian values and some Christian morals.  I disagree with Christianity in a lot of ways and don't believe in the same things as they do.  Atheism and Christianity both have some pros and cons.  I believe that there is a god and he dictates weather you go to Heaven or Hell based on your life.  However I believe he is fair and judges you as an overall person, if you‚Äôre humane.  Not on a rickety set of fucked up morals and beliefs Christians have.  You can not prove that some higher power, deity, or higher state of being exists; therefore I will keep believing it.  I think there can be a scientific for everything.  My belief is that god, for example, has not been around forever.  Like the natural fear of the dark, or fire, he has become ingrained in our psyche.  He is a belief in a higher power, a life after death.  In some studies about near death experiences (NDE) the people with that had some kind of NDE have seen some bright light, someone or something comforted them saying something along the lines of ""Now is not your time, go on."" or ""I do not need you yet, go home.""  Some higher power is ingrained into our psyche and is believed by most people.  Even in the smallest forms, believing in luck(good or bad), superstition, and even some paranormal activities.  These can be seen as life after death of some spiritual plane(stuck between Heaven and the Mortal plane(let's call the space we can inhabit that), or Hell and the Mortal plane).  Different dimensions possibly?  See, using science to explain religion.  God is an idea or belief in my opinion, or possibly a Spirit, or even some higher form of being.  If you have questions about my beliefs (probably not), want to point something out to me, or want to theorize or discuss I will be happy to!  Comment please! I love feedback! Your guys amaze me every time I log in!","Would you possibly describe yourself as an agnostic, or something more/less than that?","I think you need to stop going to /r/atheism and ask yourself first what is important to you and what *you* think of religion and why. You said you have but religious outlooks are something that are discovered over a lifetime, you shouldn't give up on it in weeks without very, very careful consideration about the validity of your beliefs.   /r/Atheism is truly a circle jerk that doesn't really present religious views very fairly before smashing down their strawmen. This is all coming from someone who is an atheist and really enjoys debating religion. /Atheism is *not* the place to find what you believe and why. It is a safe place for atheists to express their opinions. If you want to explore other areas religion hub and debate religion (in the side bar) are much better places to have an open discussion about your beliefs (IMO).  If you care about your girlfriend past religious views it really shouldn't matter. Most theists aren't the slobbering anti science, homophobic, YEC's that /r/atheism portrays them to be.  There are a few specific points in your post that I would like to adress though.  &gt;I believe in evolution, quantum theory, human psychology, and advanced other scientific theories.  This is the worst part of /r/atheism IMO. There *are* people out there who deny scientific theories because of religious views. This is *not* the stance of everyone though. Not all Christians are young earth creationists.  &gt;Not on a rickety set of fucked up morals and beliefs Christians have.  Again, /r/atheism showing through here. Most christians aren't the WBC. Most don't follow old testament laws. Many people are christians and have the same morals as you and me just gain them from a different area.  &gt;You can not prove that some higher power, deity, or higher state of being **does not** exists; therefore I will keep believing it.  Bolded by me. Is that what you meant or am I just confused?  &gt;In some studies about near death experiences (NDE) the people with that had some kind of NDE have seen some bright light, someone or something comforted them saying something along the lines of ""Now is not your time, go on."" or ""I do not need you yet, go home.""  Personally, I wouldn't use NDE's to justify my belief in an afterlife if I were you. **Near** death experience means that they didn't actually die. The brain is a very complex organ and when it is malfunctioning very strange things can happen.  Just a personal note from me that I don't believe it is a very valid argument.  TL;DR Shut out /r/atheism. Delete all of the positions of /r/atheism from your brain. Have some soulsearching without /r/atheism's pollution and if you are still unsure come over to /r/debatereligion and creep for awhile to see some more intelligent arguments put forth from both sides.",comment_2,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

The two main competing views are that the story is **literal** and that it's **allegorical**. Both views bring their own set of problems to the table. However, I personally take the view that the story is **allegorical**. This is a predominant view amongst open theologians and liberal Christians.   I believe the story is allegorical for a few reasons:  1. The consensus from all terrestrial and cosmological scientific data suggests that the earth is not less around 6,000 years old, as outlined in the Biblical timeline. The age of the earth is not exclusive to allegory, but it does leave room for questioning. (Note: Christians who believe in a literal 6-days of creation and a literal 6,000 year timeline are known as **Young Earth Creationists** or **YEC** for short).  2. The Book of Revelation is largely regarded as allegorical in nature, even though in most of the book, it's never explicitly stated. The chances that the Book of Genesis is framed in the same manner should not be taken of the table.  3. Genesis has multiple literary schemes in the original Hebrew language, but much of it is written as poetry. This says to me that it was relayed through oral accounts as folklore, not history.  4. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence for evolution; from vestigial legs on whales to recent variations of species. The fossil records are also largely consistent when compared on average, not separately.   This is my view and I do not wish to enter into a derogatory debate, but I'm open to civil discussion. If you have an opposing view, you may want to create a separate response to the OP and link to it when responding here. That way, the differing views are easier to reference.

There are many references to the three watches of the night; this reasonably seems to me to be 18:00 - 22:00 (first watch), 22:00 - 02:00 (second watch), 02:00 - 06:00 (third watch) if we can assume the basic Indian night was 12 hours. /u/lucid24-frankk did [some research](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/three-watches-of-the-night/6944/8) into the watches of the night, indicating these same times with the addition that 22:00 - 02:00 is the proper time for Bhikkhus to sleep (thanks frankk!)    From what I understand, Buddhist days start at dawn, unlike Abrahamic traditions (sunset) and our modern timekeeping (midnight). Worth throwing in here somewhere :-)   Also deviating from this ""60 hours in a day and night"" measurement, if we can consider the night to consist of 3 parts, going from the suttas we can easily see how the day divides into 2 parts: 06:00 (dawn) -- 12:00 (noon) is the ""proper time for eating"" while 12:00 (noon) -- 18:00 (dusk) is the ""improper time for eating"" (in a Bhikkhu's day).   Out of the many things I'm a nerd about, I'm a nerd about calendars and timekeeping systems. If anyone knows enough to help me fill in the gaps (whether based on hard evidence or through speculation) I'd love to release a Pali clock + calendar as a proof-of-concept and maybe write a bit on it. If we come up with different speculations for hours and weeks, I can implement all of those in parallel.   /u/bksubhuti has previously worked on a [Buddhist sun app](https://americanmonk.org/buddhist-sun-app/) and a [Buddhist qibla](https://americanmonk.org/buddhist-compass/) (compass app pointing to Bodh Gaya) ; if you have any interest with Buddhist timekeeping or a Buddhist timekeeping/calendering app, I would love your input Bhante!","I couldn't find any verification for ""ancient Buddhists had 60 hour days"" but [some](https://vedikheritageblog.wordpress.com/jyotisha-an-introduction/the-hindu-solar-calendar/) [research](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/ghatika#history) [into](https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/ghatika-yantra-time-measurement-in-days-of-no-sunlight-in-ancient-india/) [Hindu/Vedic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Hindu_units_of_measurement) (4 links!) timekeeping seems to substantiate a similar timekeeping metric as that single resource suggests:   * 1 day = 60 Ghadika * 1 Ghadika = 60 Vighati (24 minutes) * 1 Vighati = 60 Lipta (24 seconds) * 1 Lipta = 0.4s   Water clocks are a very old standard of timekeeping, with water clocks in India dating back to some 2000 years before the Buddha. ""Ghatika"" is a standard water clock that takes 24 minutes to fill, and thus fills 60 times a day; additional units of time are broken up by 60s. (similar to our minutes and seconds: 60*60 seconds per hour).  So each watch of the night is approximately 1/6 of the day, thus 10 ghatika; the appropriate time for eating is 1/4 of the day, or 15 ghatika.   I only see evidence for this in sites discussing Hinduism or Vedic tradition and in ?Sanskrit? language. Does anyone know about the use of water clocks in the Buddha's time? Some cursory searches in Sutta Central are fruitless. There are some results for ""hour"", ""minute"", ""second"" but my Pali skills are not strong enough to follow that thread.   For those interested in seeing a ""Hindu clock"", [there's one available here](https://hinducalendar.app/time) -- providing location seems to be for setting the right sunrise/sundown times. It's very easy to see the watches of the night and the proper/improper times for eating, since the top of the clock is sunrise, right side is noon, bottom is sunset, etc.   In practice, I'd think it's universal among monastics to use Western timekeeping for hours, or special apps for determining solar noon/moon phases on cloudy days.","The time-keeping system that Indians used at the time of the Buddha had most likely already been devised by past Hindus. There's a nice article on Wikipedia about the [classic Hindu system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_units_of_time). The closest equivalent of an hour is a [muhurta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhurta), which lasts 48 minutes, thus dividing the day into 30 segments instead of 24. It's worth mentioning that according to this system, the best time for meditation is the [brahmamuhurta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmamuhurtha), which begins 1 hour and 36 minutes before sunrise, and coincides with the time when the Buddha reached complete liberation.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.7887987652

What purpose do these rules serve? Do you follow them? Why?,"Good question! I am a Vaishnava, and we definitely have rules about food! I'll start out by saying that these are actually more like guidelines for those interested in spirituality; they facilitate behaviors that are conducive to developing transcendental knowledge.   The first guideline is to not eat meat, fish, or eggs. In modern society, some people have started extending this to dairy. The idea is that to develop love for God, we have to understand what love is. We have to practice it and be able to love our fellow living entities. The seed of love is compassion. Killing and causing suffering to animals is considered to be inconsistent with and counterproductive to the goal of learning compassion.   There are also rules to limit or eliminate the consumption of intoxicants and onions &amp; garlic. These are both based on the effect these have on the psyche, hampering clear vision and intelligence.  Finally, a serious practitioner will offer all food to God before eating it. This sanctifies the food and turns what is normally simply an act of sense gratification into a meditation on God and an act of devotion. Our tradition teaches that God doesn't really want us to offer the carcasses of other creatures. So, if one is going to eat only sanctified food, that can't include meat, fish, or eggs.",Very interesting!

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/tellusofyourgods.jsonl,tellusofyourgods.jsonl,29v959,Divine Thought Universalism,"Before you read this, please understand that I do not claim to be a philosopher, scientist, physicist, etc. I admit I could be wrong one or all levels. My background is Christianity, but the past few years I've been questioning all things (not just religion).   That being said, while deep in meditation a few weeks ago, I had a sort of Theophany that I call Divine Thought Universalism. I wrote down a numbered list of the basics of this idea I came to. Just thought I'd share. Any friendly thoughts on my admittedly hastily written idea are welcome!     1. Reality: What is perceived.   There are two places I‚Äôve never been to that I‚Äôve always wanted to visit: Saturn and someone else‚Äôs mind. I only know each place exists because I‚Äôve been told as a child they do. I‚Äôve come to the realization that everything that I‚Äôm told exists (the world, the universe, Saturn, etc.) is just that, something I take on good faith. It‚Äôs a belief. It takes as much faith to believe that God exists as it does Brad Pitt, or Saturn. I‚Äôve never seen any of them, only been told they do by other people. Scientists will tell me Saturn or thoughts exists based on studies and facts and science, but if I haven‚Äôt seen any of it myself or done the science myself, how is their argument anymore valid or trustworthy than he who says God is real based on his experience (NOTE: For the purpose of this writing, from here on out when God is referred to, it is not necessarily a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù God or any other religion‚Äôs god, but for the sake of this paper, just a deity)? I must naturally assume that only what is translated by my senses is real, or reality. For example, while immersed in a virtual reality game that stimulates the senses, my reality is within that game, because that is what my ‚Äúself‚Äù is experiencing; what you might call the real world outside the game is merely a place where my body is, but not reality because it is not what I am experiencing. Therefore, what is not being interpreted by my senses into reality, does not exist. Only what is observed (or smelled, heard, etc.) exists. If I am engaged in conversation with someone who is standing on my left, and I look to my right, they cease to exist until I turn my gaze back to the left, unless they are still speaking and I can hear them, or my hand is theirs and I feel them, or even if they ate an onion bagel and I can smell their breath. But, that being said, I‚Äôll take things one step further: in that moment when my gaze is turned opposite of that person, the sound of their voice as they talk (or their smell, etc.) does not prove their existence, but only the existence of that sound. To summarize things: Reality is only that which is perceived by the senses into the brain., and everything can only prove itself but can in conjunctions with other sensory information prove the existence of a larger (insert noun), For example, the sound of someone‚Äôs voice doesn‚Äôt demonstrate a person‚Äôs existence, but the sound of their voice coupled with the sight of their body does. Nothing is real, except what is perceived.   2. The Universe: the Thought, and the Thinker  Now that I have shown what reality is, I will discuss the universe, or rather, the lack of one. If everything ceases to exist when unobserved, then that has a grand and fairly obvious implication: The universe has no physical properties. While this seems preposterous, consider this: human thought (or at least my thought as I can‚Äôt prove anyone else has thoughts) exists and can manufacture anything I	 can imagine without ever taking on physical properties other than what scientists tell me is physically happening in my brain. While my brain is finite and far from understanding most things past a basic level, thought itself is infinite and is with infinite capabilities. It is my understanding that God is the great thinker. The universe is his singular thought. How I come to experience it will be discussed on the next section. His mind is infinite, and thinks the complexity of what is perceived by me. He is the only being to exist. His nature is one of self-discovery.  In posing the question of His own existence, he realized he had always existed but hadn‚Äôt acknowledged it until asking the question and in asking realized he existed and that is how even He could even question anything. As soon as he had this self-discovery, I came into being, but not as my current self.       3. The Micro: my own Consciousness  As I understand it, I can‚Äôt prove anyone else‚Äôs consciousness so I assume I am alone in the world (RE: God‚Äôs thought). Furthermore, to justify my consciousness‚Äô existence, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion I exist as God‚Äôs ‚Äúviewfinder‚Äù. As He thinks it, I see it and experience it. His proverbial ‚ÄúMind‚Äôs Eye‚Äù, if you will. I fulfill His purpose, though I am not without free will. I do not see evidence of pre-destination, but rather see it as His mind‚Äôs eye being allowed to wander, to consider the world and all possibilities.  The purpose of this will be discussed in a forthcoming section.  4. The Macro: Singular Reincarnation, the Multiverse, and the Metaverse  The concept of reincarnation is true to this theory but only coupled with the concept of a multiverse (multiple universes existing either within or without each other). Throughout history, countless people have led countless different lives, but only one consciousness has existed through all of these: mine. I am not claiming ownership over this consciousness, but this consciousness specifically ascribes to me currently. With each ‚Äúlife‚Äù(there is no life nor death, only different thoughts considered by the Thinker) I(RE: The Consciousness, or the ‚Äúviewfinder"") experience a new scenario. Each life is a metaverse (a universe within a universe). His consciousness (RE: THE consciousness) is an inner universe within the outer universe, his surroundings and point in time. Each ‚Äúlife‚Äù is lived to fulfill the Purpose.   5. The Purpose: all things considered and transcendence   When God became self-aware of his own existence, the viewfinder consciousness also came into existence by necessity. The Divine Purpose is for God to think and consider all things to achieve perfection, perfection being defined in this case as complete and all-encompassing totality. To consider every possibility including all creative, mathematical, physical, metaphysical, philosophical, emotional, social, etc. He will achieve this over innumerable amount of years by constantly having the viewfinder live out different scenarios simultaneously experiencing literally everything, despite the viewfinder being of only one consciousness (this will be explained in section six, the Time section).  God is in a disembodied state of perfection right now due to the fact that He is infinite and capable of thinking and considering all things (if you were to put all the pieces of a bicycle in a room together, it would in a sense be a bike since it has the capability and all the components necessary, but wouldn‚Äôt be a true and complete bike until assembled, or a series of corresponding words is a story, but it's not a book until they're arranged in the predetermined order). Once God has considered all things via the viewfinder, he will achieve a sort of transcendence into true perfection. At this time he will no longer need the view finder and thus the universe (the Thought) as the viewfinder sees it will cease to exist, must like the protagonist of a dream ceases once the dreamer wakes up. Thus is the purpose of the Universe.    6: Time as a plane   Time is often understood to be linear, and some assume that a deity would see time as circular, or even cyclical. In this case, neither is true. Time is a plane in which all scenarios play out. Imagine time as the paper in which life is drawn upon. God is the artist, the viewfinder is the pen, the Thought Universe is the paper.   7. Summary   In the beginning God was. But God was not self-aware. Once God questioned his self-awareness, he realized the fact that he could question something meant He existed. He realized he was capable of perfection but was not complete. He created a universe in which to consider all things to obtain true and complete knowledge, and a consciousness born without pre-disposition or pre-destination was created by necessity to experience all things considered. This will play out for a very long time until God becomes complete and transcends into a perfect deity. The implication of this is that nothing the viewfinder will ever experience is technically real, only real because he is experiencing it. He is also alone since everyone he knows or will meet is his own consciousness playing out a different metaverse in a different time on the plane of time. The thought is overwhelming but also comforting to know that this is no other purpose to ‚Äúlife‚Äù other than to experience everything both fantastic and tragic, so that all may be considered.","I...love you....I guess...because...I love I.

I thought this was an interesting argument and should be discussed separately from the other problem I posted. I came across this argument in a comment from Jeffery Jay Lowder(He formulated it) left on Randal Rauser's blog(https://randalrauser.com/2018/05/shrewd-as-snakes-the-christian-and-the-psychopath/). I rewrote it partially in my own words.  1.	**Some moral handicaps have a neurological basis.** a.	Proper functioning emotional capacities are important to our ability to choose to do morally good. (i.e, Empathy is important in identifying how a person is feeling so we can properly respond and understand the impact of our action on others) b.	Neuroscience reveals that certain brain abnormalities cause people to feel no empathy.( i.e psychopathy).  2.	**Theism is not intrinsically more probable than naturalism.** a.	Supernaturalism and naturalism are symmetrical claims. Theism makes all the claims of supernaturalism but adds several more (i.e that the mental entity behind the natural world is personal. That the entity is omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent). Therefore, theism is at least not more intrinsically probable than naturalism   3.	**The neurological basis of moral handicaps is more probable on naturalism than on theism.** a.	If theism is true, this means: (1) God creates human beings with moral handicaps that are not a result of freely chosen actions of any human being (2) These moral handicaps make it more likely afflicted humans will carry out morally evil actions  b.	God would need some moral justification for allowing (1) and (2).It seems unlikely on a theistic point of view that God would allow (1) and (2) to obtain c.	More probable on naturalism since blind nature would be indifferent to moral consequences of brain abnormalities.  4.	**Other evidence held equal, Theism is probably false.**",This is just the argument from natural ‚Äòevil‚Äô all over again.,"Psychopaths think differently, but I've never seen proof that they have no free will.

He didn't even really mention Christians who could disagree with him, even in a, ""They're not real Christians"" way--he just speaks as if all Christians align with his way of thinking.

It didn't technically reach cult-level because it was pretty easy to leave and lots of people did/do with no repercussions, but it was inching towards culty to the point that my husband's family was pretty worried about their involvement.","Yeesh, that‚Äôs horrifying!

We're an active member family, have callings, have 2 little kids. The ""little message"" they wanted to share was that they wanted to practice teaching the 1st discussion (even though one is a former AP and both have been out for 18+ months. I would have preferred a 1 verse spiritual thought).  I've posted here before about my doubts (Nephite civilization is Wakanda, etc), but I had a new question about ""covenant people"" come to me while they were teaching.  ""God calls prophets."" Ok. We know Moses and Noah and Abraham. Why does he only ever call prophets within a select population? Where's the ancient Chinese prophets and their records (ignoring the massive amounts of systematic censorship and book burning throughout China's history....)? Where's the ancient Japanese prophets? Aboriginal Australian? Indonesian? Babylonian? Assyrian? Proto-Iranian? Bantu? Wouldn't God want to reach out to these people as well? Would he not teach the same gospel to them?   I mean, if we have this history of God calling prophets, prophets preaching to the people, and people rejecting the prophets, wouldn't you figure it's a numbers game like anything else? Why limit yourself to generations of one single race instead of sending/calling prophets in all geographies in every instance of apostasy?   I think my faith would be hugely bolstered if I found out the same church/gospel/religion had been established at least temporarily in all parts of the earth with proven records showing the same teachings across cultures. (NOTE: I just looked up Nineveh and see that there are some cross-confirmation between the biblical story of Jonah's visit and stories in the Tanakh and Koran. Since the biblical story came about through the Tanakh, and since the Koran draws heavily from a familiarity with biblical teachings, I'm inclined to say this doesn't really count.)  Instead it seems like God was like ""nah, forget those people. I'm gonna keep sending my prophets to this one group over here"" (I promise I'm not being anti-Semitic, just doubtful of the whole process).   The Dead Sea Scrolls I think showed a lot of promise to Latter-day Saints, but turned out to be kind of a dud. Or at least nothing we ever discuss in church.   Out of the mouth of two or three witnesses vs God only gives us what we can handle vs we're not ready for more cuz we barely live by the commandments we have.","A covenant, or chosen people stems from polytheism (my team is better than your team).  Its application in monotheistic cultures is quite offensive.    ""I love all my kids, but mostly you, so you should hold that over them and use it to oppress them.

The thing is I'm currently depressed and laying in bed most days without doing much at all and I'm bored out my mind with no motivation to do anything. I don't really read the bible or pray because I just have no desire to do so and when I do try and get myself into a routine of praying or reading the bible it just ends up failing as I only last one or two days and then I just get really bored and lose willpower to continue on. I'm just going round in a vicious cycle of non commitment and I've tried praying for God to give more strength or energy to be a Christian but my prayers have not been answered.   It doesn't help that I've got this obsession with fantasy meaning I'd constantly think about living in a fantasy world such as in fiction or something. This in turn makes me even more depressed as I'm not living in fantasy and that's one of the reasons why I find life so boring as most things just seem fairly dull to me as I'm comparing it to something fantastical. While on the subject of fantasy one thing I struggle with is idolising fantasy females as goddesses even though I no I shouldn't but I cant help it.  I've seen therapists before but they couldn't help me with my Christian issues and I've spoke to a Christian therapist before but he didn't really help. I've spoken to other Christians but the best advice I've gotten is to try and meet God halfway which again I would if I wasn't stuck in this rut which I can't seem to break free of. So basically in short I don't know what to do as I have no desire or purpose to be a Christian or serve God in anyway and every time I do try it just ends up going nowhere with me feeling bad or just empty inside. Anyway that's the short version of things anyway and if anybody has anything to say then that would be nice but if not thanks for reading my post anyway.  &#x200B;,"Maybe the fear of the Lord might help.

[Rant]","So very sorry for the wall of text, I just need to throw out my feelings and write it  all down here before I explode into crying heaping mess. It's so messed up I can't see my phone screen writing this.  Islam as a religion has taken so much away from me, especially my right for personal freedom, to be me in the truest form. Living under Islam, I wasn't allow to develop myself as a person, know my tastes in music, my sexuality, my freedom to explore who I wanted to be and what I want to do with my life.  So excuse me if I never defend my once useless excuse of a religion anymore!!! I made a vow never to talk bad about it as I truly feel (and I still do) that religion may help certain people, but hell may freeze over before I say something good about it. Why is it very hard for these people to understand that I just want a life free of religion and full of choices THAT I CAN MAKE ON MY OWN?!  For example, if I got a tattoo or have a piercing, it is very hard to just appreciate it from afar? It is a statement of who I am, why does it concern you? For once, think about what you are saying and how it may hurt the feelings of the listener! Instead of regurgitating out dogma from religion! If you have nothing nice to say, don't say nothing!!!  And another thing, I'm done being all sneaky about it all. I'm done. I'm admitting it to anyone who cares to listen: I am a woman who loves other women. There, I said it. My future partner will be standing proudly beside me, and I will NEVER be ashamed of it. I am just a normal girl who likes girly things. And I am also a LESBIAN and proud of it.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/ChristianApologetics.jsonl,ChristianApologetics.jsonl,csharo,[Help] I have some questions,"Firstly, my apologies if this is not the right place to ask questions like this.   I'm quite new to my faith. I've read and watched a lot of Hugh Ross and various other Apologists (is that the right word?). I've also watched a lot of Ray Comfort videos (and recently got his ""Evidence Bible"" too). I'm currently reading ""On Guard"" by William Lain Craig.   I'm just so confused and conflicted in terms of creation and the age of things. Obviously, Ray Comfort is a Young Earth Creationist, which up until recently in my life I found absolutely absurd. And yet, it's what the Bible teaches, right? And if Jesus quotes scripture as fact, surely we are intended to take it as fact.  On the one hand, you have people like Hugh Ross, who try to marry up scripture and science (for example, saying the creation days were not 24 hour days) but then you have others who argue that there's no justification for believing that (given that the word ""Yom"" is only ever used as a 24 hour day everywhere else in the Bible). The more I read other people the less I feel confident in what Hugh Ross says, because it often does seem like he's really stretching things to try to match it up to modern science.  But, on top of all of that... How do you explain the fact that archaeological discoveries have found things far older than 6000 or so years? As much as I want to, I'm just really struggling to reconcile things like this in my mind (not to mention Evolution etc) as being compatible with belief in the Old Testament.   So I guess I want to know what you guys believe regarding creation and evolution and things like that, and how that links into your faith/what the Bible says. Is it really possible to believe in Jesus Christ and everything he said, but then not also take Genesis and other Old Testament stories as fact? And if so, how would you counter people telling you that you're just picking and choosing what to believe?  Once again, sorry if this is not the right type of post for here and I'm happy to delete it if thats the case.",i'm sure there are way better than ray comfort.... all he ever trots out is the watchmaker fallacy.,"If you can give me any recommendations I'd be happy to check them out.

I‚Äôm not sure myself since I was not very far into the book so I don‚Äôt know if I should continue or abandon?

Thanks!,"Personally, I'm of the opinion that if a fantasy series for children is enough to shake one's faith, then one's faith wasn't built on anything solid to begin with. HDM is a series that critiques religion - to some extent, Pullman was approaching it as a sort of anti-Narnia - but encountering ideas you disagree with isn't a bad thing, imo. You can read it, see what you think of it, and then move on. Our fathers and mothers in the church, true doctors of the church like St. Augustine and St. Catherine of Siena, could never have learned and written the things they did without having considered ideas contrary to their beliefs.   For me, I stopped reading the books because I found Lyra utterly intolerable, but I've read commentaries on the books and have plenty of friends who are both religious and HDM fans. There are multiple ways to read the ""anti-Christian"" aspects of the series, from a full-on ""religion is the opiate of the masses"" approach to a ""this is essentially what Vatican II existed to do in the Catholic Church"" approach to a ""it's a fictional story and the religion depicted isn't the faith I practice here in the real world"" approach.  There's no one right answer - with a good book (including *the* Good Book), I don't think there ever is. Ultimately, you should do what you think is best for you! I just caution anyone who thinks being a Christian means they have to close their ears to contrary opinions.

Every day when I went to school my mother would ransack my room. She'd read anything, and everything, I wrote in my journal (that she insisted I keep and write in). She'd go through any photos or keepsakes I had, she'd find anything I hid.  She'd interrogate me over anything she found concerning, from a mere mention of a girl I liked in a journal, to any drawings or cartoons, or action figures fighting each other and ask things like ""Why are you having these violent fantasies?!? What's wrong with you?!?""  She'd stop me coming out of the bathroom and openly ask me if I was masturbating starting at age 11, before I even knew what it was.

Anyway the first letter I wrote to him was some good brotherly life advice on how to thrive as a missionary. Even though preaching and trying to win converts to your religion sucks on every level, I learned some pretty valuable life lessons in those two years and wanted to share some jewels of wisdom with him. In my second letter, I  intrduced him to every historical, scientific, and doctrinal problem I could think of. You know the usual- Problems with multiple first vision accounts, BOM historicity and absolute lack thereof, Book of Abraham nonsense, the changing Nature of the Mormon God, the conclusions of BH Roberts that the BOM was most likely written by Joseph with the help of others, the magical worldview of early church leaders predominantly Joseph Oliver and practically all the BOM witnesses, Joseph's polygamy and polyandry, how the church receives timely revelations at the expense of losing revenue or property (1890 Manifesto, the second manifesto, blacks and the priesthood in 1978), and a few others. I of course did not put it on too thick, just gave a brief introduction to each topic in an obejective. I simply stated that these were issues he would likely come across in talking with people about Mormonism and he should be aware of them and seek further light and knowledge concerning them. For his sake and for the sake of those he teaches.  I also encouraged him that if he, his companions, or any of his investigators had questions regarding these issues he should write me and I would be glad to help answer them.

Please be sure to keep your comments to the correct chapter.       ---  **About the book**  &gt;Trust is the basis for every relationship. So what happens when that foundation cracks?   &gt; * A cheating spouse destroys the feelings of confidence and fidelity in a marriage. &gt; * A friend's betrayal causes mistrust to spread to your other close relationships. &gt; * An undermining co-worker creates a suspicious, tense, disjointed workplace. &gt; * Organizational board members work in secret to form coalitions to assume control.  &gt; Trust plays a key role in every arena of our lives, because trust is the linchpin for all our relationships‚Äìfamily, school, church, work, and community. And how we sort out all the issues of trust and mistrust determines the direction our lives will take‚Äìand our ultimate happiness and fulfillment. How can we build deeper, stronger trust in our relationships? How can we cope when that trust has been wounded or destroyed? How can we live a life of trust without being na√Øve about betrayal?  &gt;In Who Can You Trust? one of America's most beloved leaders, Howard E. Butt, Jr., candidly shares his own real-life experience and expertise to help you answer these questions in a biblical and practical way. He helps you recognize and resolve past trust issues that have shattered your faith and your spirit. And he shows you how to let your faith help you build stronger trust in the future for all your most important relationships.",**Chapter 1 - Looking Over Our Shoulder**   *The only way to make a man trustworthy is to trust him; and the surest way to make him untrustworthy is to distrust him and show your distrust* - Henry Lewis Stimson,"I can't help but make the connection between the trust being described and Fear. Is our post 9-11/Enron world a less trusting one? Perhaps, but did we ever truly trust large corporations to be moral? I would figure the 80s put paid to that for modern generations.   I'd say then, the issue is not just trust, but also fear. It is our lack of trust that causes us to live more fearfully. we're just as certain a trustworthy person will succeed as we are an untrustworthy person will fail, so isn't it our reaction to the certainty of both scenarios that is at fault here?  Why should it be that one certainty produces optimism and hope, yet another causes us to despair, fear and feel doomed? In a biblical sense, why do we feel confident God's plan will prevail over the good people do, yet is not soverign enough to cope with the certain disappointment others produce?  Isn't my own fearfulness as a result of distrust, more about my lack of trust in God and His plan, than the person I'm distrustful of?  I thought the quote from Joseph A Grudfest is worth mulling over, the line about: &gt;Societies which have a low degree of trust are backward societies.  It certainly seems reinforced by the commentary about locks on our doors and cars and taking it to one conclusion, the big brother scenario, I think it is clear that's a backwards step. One of the things that broke my heart was hearing that a neighbour in sub division, had lived here 5-6 years and never met a neighbour. I got told that about a year and I still haven't followed up with that person or reached out beyond my immediate neighbours. We all want that inclusive open community, we miss what we see as golden years of community from generations past, but I know I'm just as held back by fear of inviting strangers into my home as everyone else. ""What if they see we have nice stuff and want to rob us?"" Depressing isn't it?  The line ""Pure distrust - distilled over time - shrivels us, our live turn in on ourselves, our existence becomes unbearable"", really hits home for me. I've struggled with depression in the past and lack of trust left me a hermit. Even close friends I'd know for years, I'd question their motives when they'd invite me out. Why, exactly, do they want me at that party, to see me make an ass of myself? to point and laugh? Probably just pity, right? I could never trust their friendship was on the level. Who was I to have such awesome friends? I should stay home and hide. And I did, for many years.  In closing he talks about how we want to trust, how we don't want to be cynical. I can't say I follow that, I think we're more ready in this world to distrust. It is much harder to convince people of a noble and pure truth, than it is that someone screwed up. We're much faster to believe the worst of people than the best and perhaps that's partly down to pride (we don't want to see others succeed where we fail) more than distrust reigning supreme, but I'd say a trusting nature, doesn't seem to be the prevailing attitude I get from friends and family.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.7507257921

Baha‚Äôis believe that Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah is infallible, so it seems to me that they would believe everything He wrote without question and take it seriously.  ‚ÄúIt behoveth the people of Bah√° to die to the world and all that is therein, to be so detached from all earthly things that the inmates of Paradise may inhale from their garment the sweet smelling savor of sanctity, that all the peoples of the earth may recognize in their faces the brightness of the All-Merciful, and that through them may be spread abroad the signs and tokens of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise. ***They that have tarnished the fair name of the Cause of God, by following the things of the flesh‚Äîthese are in palpable error!‚Äù***   [Gleanings From the Writings of Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h, pp. 100-101](https://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-46.html.utf8?query=flesh&action=highlight#pg101)  ‚ÄúSuffer not the habitation wherein dwelleth My undying love for thee to be destroyed through the tyranny of covetous desires, and ***overcloud not the beauty of the heavenly Youth with the dust of self and passion.‚Äù*** [Gleanings, p. 323](http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-153.html.utf8?query=self&action=highlight#gr1)  ‚ÄúIt behoveth thee to consecrate thyself to the Will of God. Whatsoever hath been revealed in His Tablets is but a reflection of His Will. ***So complete must be thy consecration, that every trace of worldly desire will be washed from thine heart.*** This is the meaning of true unity. ‚Äú [Gleanings, p. 338](http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-160.html.utf8?query=self&action=highlight#gr2)  Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah wrote that those who love God have no desire except the good-pleasure of God and reunion with Him.   ‚ÄúThink not that because these things have come to pass after Husayn‚Äôs martyrdom, therefore all this glory hath been of no profit unto him. For that holy soul is immortal, liveth the life of God, and abideth within the retreats of celestial glory upon the Sadrih of heavenly reunion.

However, we are not there yet, we are it seems actually quite far away from that now.   Concerning sexual desire in particular you said it has nothing to do with God, however I don't think that is true. Sexual desire serves a purpose that can have a spiritual basis just like all other things we do; in this case it would be the consequent rearing of children which is highly valued. You might be aware that permanent birth control is prohibited, and two parties agreeing prior to a marriage to never have children violates the spirit of the law.[[2](https://bahai.works/Lights_of_Guidance/Birth_Control#1162)] That should help us distinguish between sexual desire for itself, vs sexual desire that has the potential to be purposeful.   The natural question that leads from this line of thinking is, well then is sex only permissible if it's procreative? But the fact that birth control is permissible implies that sex that is non-procreative is permissible. It is each of ours task to pray and meditate on these types of issues to figure out how to best apply them in our lives.","The goal is to empty the cup of self, such that we can let God's living waters fill up our cup.

Now do Daesh/ISIS have violent Kharijite tendencies, Yes but are they Kharijites, by Aqeedah, No. daesh/ISIS strictly justify their beliefs through Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Ibn Ishaq, Tabari etc. Whereas Kharijites were more Quran-Centrists but the extremist amongst them went to another level. Also, Daesh/ISIS are racist to the core when it comes to leadership & top positions, the leader has to be Arab from the Quraysh tribe with Arab-Non Qurayshis after that, then Afghans & Central Asians & White Converts in the middle , South Asian Muslims & African Muslims at the bottom, there are many article about Arab supremacy within Daesh/ISIS ranks. Whereas Kharijites believed any Muslim who is pious can be a leader even he he Black, Hindi, Farsi, Amazigh, hence Berber Amazigh Kharijites kicked the arses of Ummayyad Arab-Supremacist, they even had Persian Kharijite Kingdom, also a Ibadi brother told me that they had Arab-Speaking African Muslim rulers. Also many Anti-Ottoman Sunnis hated Ottomans not because of Aqeedah because they were not Qurayshi Arab. I think Ummayyads forced scholars to fabricate narrations against certain groups to further their agenda. Even Timur Leng was not accepted by many Sunnis because he was not Qurayshi Arab nor accepted by Shias because he didn‚Äôt have Sayyed Hashemite Blood, hence he claim bringing back Mongol Empire but with an Islamic flavor rather than your Tengriist-Shamanist or Buddhist Mongol flavor. Had Timur Leng read about Kharijites or Ibadhism, he may converted to Ibadhism, but he came a Naqshbandi Sufi only because the area he lived was heavily influenced by Naqshbandi Sufi type Islam & so were the people.","Hi xterminator2021.

I‚Äôm 40 year old man, married 17 years and two kids, 11 and 9. I used to be an agnostic (maybe a very curious agnostic?) and my wife was and probably still is more of a cultural Christian. My wife wanted to be in a church before our first child was born and we‚Äôve been in this same one for 12 years. There have been some really great people over the years that God has used to help me believe there even is a God and a little over a year ago I would say my heart finally softened and I was convicted of my sins and fully believed in what Christ has done for me and repented.  The preacher that was there when we started is no longer there due to an emotional affair a few years ago with a female member. He was replaced by one of the elders in an interim basis and when that preacher got cancer several months later, there was an interim pastor from Lifeway that preached there (this is a Southern Baptist church not far from Nashville.) When our pastor got sick, the search for a new pastor was very strange. The interim preacher from Lifeway was the head of the committee. I believe it was two years before a name even emerged. During this time the brother that got cancer died. They brought in a preacher on a Sunday. I think we were told on that Friday he would be preaching and some details on his background, which was basically that he preached at a church for 2.5 years in SC and things didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwork out‚Äù there. After he was done he went out and we were told we were going to vote on making him our Head Pastor and he passed.  Since then two more of our elders have passed. Our worship and children‚Äôs ministers left and under suspicious circumstances. I‚Äôm the past the church members voted on the elders. The new pastor hired new pastors and they seem to be Yes Men.  So here is a bullet point of my concerns: -Shortly after he arrived he wanted major renovations and essentially turn our largish church into a mega church. We voted no. March 2020 a tornado extensively damaged our church and Christian school (it‚Äôs basically a huge building with church and preschool-12). We were presented with a repair plans that all happened to essentially turn the church portion into a mega church.  -they fired the headmaster of the school for no apparent reason and the pastor fills the role now.  -the preachers family seems pretty chaotic. My wife and I work a lot in the children‚Äôs ministry and all three of his children behave terribly. My wife‚Äôs cousin is a member and she worked for the school. She received a text message from the preachers wife that was a laundry list of everything she didn‚Äôt like about her (she must have meant to send it to someone else and not who it was tearing down). Her cousin asked what was up and about a week later came to work to find a letter saying her position at the school had been eliminated (but since then they‚Äôve hired someone else to do pretty much the same job.  -I‚Äôm not crazy about the strong Lifeway influence. Personally I‚Äôve not liked how they treat their employees and they control so much. All of our life groups and children‚Äôs ministry use Lifeway materials. And along with the coffee shop there is now a Lifeway store in the building.  -he claims to be an expository preacher, but skips sections and I honestly don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm growing based on what I get out of his sermons.  It just feels shady there now, but I don‚Äôt want to go on my feelings. I feel like the first 38 years of my life I kinda just floated around and wasn‚Äôt really engaged, certainly not at church. I want to do what God wants me to do.  There have been many families that have left over the years. Two of them are led by great men that have really impacted me. They go to a church one town over. It‚Äôs a Baptist church, not SB though, and reformed. (Looking back I can see the strong impact reformed has had on me. ) I haven‚Äôt visited there but have listened to sermons and really get a lot out of them. Our current church is in the heart of our community and a 7 min drive. The other is 25 minutes and it seems an important consideration.  But‚Ä¶.there are still great people at my church. I‚Äôve had zero issues with my children‚Äôs minister  and both of my kids are serving in the ministry there. I‚Äôm obviously a young Christian with a lot to learn and I want a church that can help me grow and become a proper leader of my family. However, it seems almost like we‚Äôd be abandoning our church that may be sinking. It‚Äôs hard to communicate on here the considerations properly, but I‚Äôve got several people that have left and try to convince us to do so and several that have stayed and want us to stay and help.  So any feedback would be appreciated. Please don‚Äôt be too hard on me and my ignorance","Well if his goal is to be a megachurch, he is going to have to compromise on truth and become more attractional.  It is the fastest way to do it.","It sounds like you are a relatively young believer so you need a church that has strong biblical preaching.

To be honest I have attended the same church since I first came a believer, but if my church started shifting in the preaching or did things that didn‚Äôt align biblically or encouraging teaching that was different, I would consider the need to attend another church.

A just war can be declared if:  * **the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;** *i.e. being attacked is not sufficient - the damage must be lasting,  * **all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective;** *i.e. all other options have been exhausted, which I find hard to believe coming from the richest economies on the planet.*  * **there must be serious prospects of success;** *i.e. no suicide mission of revenge*  * **the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. The power as well as the precision of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition.** *e.g. absolutely NO nuclear, chemical or biological weapons can be justified. The damage is too great, too indiscriminate, and completely NOT proportional.The safety of the innocent can't be reasonably assured, and there is no justification in killing an innocent for the greater good.*  Once these conditions no longer apply, the justification for war needs to be re-evaluated.

I hope it's OK to ask a few questions here.  I was not raised in the CoC and came from a rather agnostic family background, yet I always had spiritual inclinations. For many years I have been a pacifist Christian and I first learned about the Community of Christ while reading about Missouri history and religion. (I currently reside near St. Louis.)  Previously I had thought that the lds church was the only latter-day denomination. I was enthralled to learn of the Community of Christ's peace testimony and the local Missouri history intrigued me. As my interest peaked, I discovered online the temple in Independence and was immediately struck by both it's  dedication to Peace as well as its architectural beauty.  This wonderful experience of discovering the Community of Christ transpired a couple years ago, and at that time I resolved to visit a local CoC church. This led to a very awkward experience which is still the cause of some pain, hurt, and even deep sorrow for me. I'm not sure how much of this experience I should share here on a public forum, I don't mind giving more details though.   Suffice it to say that I have been unable to visit a local congregation as of yet. I still find the denomination to be very attractive and would like to learn more about the faith. In a used book store I frequent I have been fortunate to acquire a copy of the Book of Mormon and also from Herald House publishing: The Priesthood Manual (1982), The Joy in Creation and Judgement by F. Henry Edwards (1975), and Question Time Volume 3 (1976). Are these goods books to start with, are there any introductory CoC books which would be more beneficial for me to obtain?  Also, my main questions are...outside of visiting a church which it doesn't seem I'll be able to do in the immediate future, may I ask questions here with some regularity? In addition to this wonderful subreddit, are there other online CoC forums in which I may seek out fellowship? As I cannot currently visit a church, what requirements would there be for baptism and could I at some point become a member of the denomination even though I'm unable to attend services? Does anyone here have any suggestions for a newcomer?  Thank you in advance for any responses!","Hi! Welcome to our quaint little subreddit. Any and all questions or experiences are welcome here. You don't need to censor yourself. We're happy that you're here engaging in our modest community!  The books you mentioned will certainly give a good historic perspective of the church, but a LOT has changed since the 70s and 80s. I'd recommend the pdf [Sharing in Community of Christ](https://www.cofchrist.org/common/cms/resources/Documents/Sharing-in-Community-of-Christ-3rd-edition.pdf) as a good starting place for learning about current church practices and theology. It's short, and it repeats much of the Basic Beleifs section of the website, but it has a bit more depth.   The [Project Zion Podcast](http://www.projectzionpodcast.org/) is another way to engage with CoC members and leadership.   I'm not sure how old you are, but the Oklahoma Mission Center has an online Young Adult Devotional every other Monday hosted on Zoom, a Skype-like app. I have ""attended"" a couple of sessions, and it's very simillar to a Community of Christ worship service. You aren't obligated to engage personally in the session. You can just tune in and observe. There's a devotional tonight at 7:30 pm Central Time. Details can be found [here](http://www.cofchristokmc.org/calendar.html).   I'm traveling for work over the next two days, and I don't think I've adequately answered all your questions.

I'm 44, and a single dad. a few years ago my younger brother passed away and shortly thereafter I went through a particularly rough divorce which exhausted me emotionally and financially.

It encouraged me or gave me hope that such a beautiful pacifist denomination was headquartered in my own state and I had found it at such a difficult time in my life. In my struggles I began reaching out to God.  Here I realized a very humbling dilemma. I was now extremely poor and without a car. I knew if I were to visit a church I would have to swallow my pride and call to inquire about a potential ride. This seemed daunting to me at first, frankly my pride caused me to feel a bit embarrassed or ashamed. Perhaps there's a bit of a taboo in the states as well regarding being carless.   I called a few churches in my area and didn't get a live person but left some messages. A few weeks passed. I was a bit disheartened at not getting anyone so looked up more numbers online and came across the ""Gateway USA Mission Center"" which was somewhat local to me. When I called I was excited to right away talk to a very kind helpful young lady, and when I explained a bit about my situation, offered graciously to call around at some local churches and see if anyone living in my area might give me a ride to church someday. A couple weeks passed without contact so I called the gateway center again and spoke with the same young lady. She said she hadn't had much luck but assured me she'd call around more and inquire. Another week or two passed, so I was really going to throw in the towel. I felt ashamed already to be without a car and felt embarrassed now to bother anyone with my troubles. I'm already a somewhat timid quiet sort of person and the though of imposing on anyone was quite uncomfortable to me. Nonetheless I viewed the church as truly a wonderful thing, so I persisted and called yet again. The young lady this time told me she had indeed found someone to potentially give me a ride to church. I was thankful and elated. She gave me a couples phone number which I called promptly.   The couple.... I spoke with the wife, who graciously told me she and her husband would be glad to answer any questions I had and that they were actually the parents of the young lady I had spoken with from the gateway center. I asked a few random questions about the church and we had pleasant brief conversation, so then I humbly asked if she and her husband may be able to someday give me a ride to church if I could help with gas money. She hesitated. After the awkward pause, she said that her and her husband would perhaps give my children and I a ride to church someday, but they would want to meet me at a McDonald's down the street from my home first to make sure. I thought that this was reasonable as they may wish to make sure I appear as safe as I sound before letting me in their car. This thought also made me feel though a bit ashamed. I felt my self-esteem lower, as if being careless was symptomatic of criminality or an offensive nature. I began wondering if perhaps my impression of the CoC was a bit askew, and perhaps it was a very close knit community that is generally culturally suspicious of outsiders or newcomers. I certainly didn't see this expressed however on sites such as the CofChrist.org.  I'm not certain still what impression I may have given her during that first conversation but it seems it wasn't a good one. I'm very soft-spoken so I can't imagine she thought me to be gruff or threatening. I'm a very Mr. Rodgers sort of personality. Perhaps she and her husband were just precautious. Maybe she fell into the American cultural notion that a person without a car who is a poor single parent must be lazy or on drugs etc. I would not fault her for thinking so. This is a common sentiment, and perhaps not one I was devoid of prior to my life becoming such a struggle.  I thanked her and said I would be happy to meet at McDonald's, and she suggested calling me the following weekend. She didn't call until a couple weeks later, and when I answered the phone, she laughed and said she called me by mistake, she had meant to call someone else. She quickly got off the phone with me, I barely said bye as she quickly hung up.   Well as I said this was all a couple years ago. I'm sorry to burden you with such a long rambling comment. I have since really given up on pursuing church but feelings about this incident in my life have lingered, then I saw this subreddit and it all came back to me in full force. I think writing this has been cathartic so I am grateful that you have so kindly granted me a place to express all this. The denomination still seems wonderful to me from my view afar and in perfect sync with my beliefs, I still look forward to visiting locally someday, I think in my ordeal described above perhaps I was just in the wrong place at th wrong time, and I'm sure that the church as a whole is benevolent and filled with the Spirit of Christ.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.9291442307

I'm enjoying having a look around this new subreddit.  I was thinking it might be easier if we could get some freely editable flair, a la /r/debatereligion.  That would allow us to get at least a basic idea of who we're talking to.  Thoughts?","I'm going to play devil's advocate and say it would be better without it.  On the other subreddits, I would think that, although helpful, the flair kind of offloads some of the thinking we do in response to a poster since the flair ""speaks for itself.""  We see religion 'X' next to some person's name, and through no fault of our own conjure up unconscious biases against X and that goes into the manufacturing of our response.   And if the poster's religion is not easily inferred by the specific post, then it is either because he/she wants to keep it that way, OR it's just not particularly relevant.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_active/islam.jsonl,islam.jsonl,q4im0,I don't want to wear the Hijab anymore. Help?,"Salam, brothers and sisters.  So... I'll cut to the chase. I started wearing the Hijab at 13. I'm 18 right now. I have an older sister, 19, who doesn't wear it, and a younger sister, 16, who doesn't wear it either. So (religious) people are often impressed with me. And I am always asked ""Why did you wear it?"" A year ago, when I was stubborn and delusional, I would think ""What a difficult question to answer..."" Now, on the other hand, I've finally come to terms with myself. Whenever someone asks me that question, the answer is quite clear in my head... *Because my friends and cousins pressured me into wearing it. Because peer pressure got to me.* But of course, I just put on a fake smile and tell them ""Because I want to please God"" or something along those lines.  And I have never felt more of a liar and fake. All the praise and ""Mashallah!""s I get from people just makes me feel even worse. I didn't wear it for Allah, and I'm not as religious and pious as people make me out to be, and I don't deserve the praise I get, and my sisters don't deserve the criticism they get for not wearing it, and they definitely don't deserve to be looked down on when compared to my ""virtues.""  I've been thinking about this for months. I'm actually not 100% sure that I *do* want to take it off... But at the same time, I am definitely not even near 50% convinced with myself wearing it. I've never felt more regretful in my life when thinking about deciding to wear it. So I've concluded that my impulse to not wearing the Hijab &gt; impulse to wear it.  But this is the hard part. I can't just simply stop wearing it. Not with my parents extremely satisfied and proud of me wearing it... not with my friends admiring my choice to wear it. Not with my extended family, relatives, and cousins all very appreciative and praiseful of my choice to wear it. Not with all the constant comparisons of me to my sisters and how I'm so much better than them... do you get my point? I'll disappoint so many people by taking it off. Especially my father and mother. I hate disappointing them, I feel like I already do that too much. And I'm also afraid of all of the judging and glares I'll get from my extended family and cousins if I take it off... And what my friends will think of such a decision.  I don't know what to do. Either I keep wearing it, and of course I will get Ajer for doing so and please Allah. But then again I'll be keeping up a fake facade to satisfy the people around me, and feel shitty about wearing it for all the wrong reasons and for being fake and not sincere. Or I could stop wearing it and not have to keep up that fake facade and feel better about not being a hypocrite. But suffer the consequences of being judged from every angle possible, being constantly questioned ""why?"", disappointing my parents, friends, relatives, and possibly (guaranteed for some people I know) losing the respect of many people...  All I can say is... Help? :( Advice, suggestions, solutions are appreciated...","You should wear it for yourself, not for others appraisal. If you don't want to wear it, unless there is some threat to you, then you don't have to.","Honestly you listed everyone that could be disappointed if you took if but the reality is that none of them matters when it comes to a religious obligation... you left out the most important reason to want to keep wearing it and the reason is Allah!  I understand the pressure one could face to act, talk, and look a certain way. But the hijab is more that satifying others around you, it is about acknowledging (after studying of course) that it is prescribed to you from Allah swt, and that obeying this (as is the case with salah, fasting, etc.) is only done to please Allah swt.   The issue of hijab as you can tell should be strictly one that is between you and God, if you want to worship Him as He asked you to , then you know what to do, but if not, then the coice is also yours.  The bottom line is that my suggestion would be to do a mini-revolution with yourself, before deciding to keep it or take it off, shift your focus to learning about what hijab is, why you wear it, what importance is holds in Islam, study the philosophy behind it.... I can guarentee that the more that you learn about it, as a woman (muslim or non) you will love it, and the more you love it, the more you will be proud to put it on everytime you leave the house.   I hope my words offer some sort of help, and I apologize if they offeded anyone. If you'd like to discuss this more, then I'll be happy to :)  Salam",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.9324352226

Are there Jewish references to animal symbolism? I would love to find one that reflects prosperity, abundance, or power. The same happens with colors, in which, for example, I understand that white denotes peace and luminosity. I would also appreciate any other suggestions.  By the way, I am not Jewish, but I love what Judaism stands for and hope one day to become a part of it.",Judaism doesn't do much of this kind of stuff.,"There is some symbolism of animals in the Torah, but they are not deep mystical ideas. In the same way that one could say ‚Äúhe is loyal as a dog‚Äù, Yaakov describes his son Yehuda as ‚Äúa lions‚Äôs whelp‚Äù and Yissakhar as a strong donkey.   Today calling someone a donkey would imply they are stupid, for Yaakov it implied that he is hardworking. In general, the symbolism of animals in the Torah is more positive than we have in modern English. But that doesn‚Äôt really help you if you are looking for a logo; you can‚Äôt have a logo of a donkey and name the company ‚ÄúJackass investors‚Äù and expect people to see it and say ‚Äúthose guy must be very hardworking like a donkey‚Äù.  As animal symbolism is just a way of talking, and not magic symbols to effect the world, there is not an animal for every idea. Powerful animals used in the Torah include a lion or an ox. I can‚Äôt think of any animal that represents ‚Äúabundance‚Äù or ‚Äúprosperity‚Äù in either modern language or in the Torah.   Maybe a logo of a fat ox? Making it red may imply the red heifer which would represent rarity and purity - which you may either want to avoid or you may want that reference.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.3866910467

It has recently become clear to me that there are massive holes within Protestantism that I have to look into. Being in my modern American bubble, I wasn't really able to step outside of my presupposions and take a look into all of the options. I am currently studying Orthodoxy and Catholicism in order to try to figure out a possible way forward. The studies have been fruitful so far. I feel that I am expanding my horizon and finding answers to a lot of problems with my current worldview. But I have a few major hangups that are making things difficult psychologically:  * I just recently became a Christian, but due to the college I attend, every Christian friend that I have is a Protestant. If I were to step away from that, they would probably either consider me ""unsaved"" or massively decieved. (If I knew for sure what was true this wouldn't be as much of a problem) * I have experienced many crazy things in my life that pointed me to God. Answered prayers, feeling transformed through the Word, and what I believe to be baptismal regeneration. There are many semi-miraculous occurances that have happened to me as well. And people I know tell stories of amazing things happening to them that lead them to be able to proclaim the Gospel and grow closer to Jesus. If Orthodoxy / Catholicism is true, am I to believe that all of these things are man-made, or even worse, that they are demonic? These people want to give their lives to God more than anyone I know. What do you guys make of this stuff? * My girlfriend (who I am poised to marry soon) has no idea about the full extent of my research. She recently became a Christian about 6 months ago. I worry that whatver step I take forward will create a barrier between us. If this stuff is true, I do not know how I would lovingly introduce her to it. You have to understand, this would mean that everything she has heard so far has to be questioned in a brand new light. Everyone she has met is slightly wrong. I just don't know if she could accept it. I don't know if I can.  * I feel crazy. I don't know how to interpert the things going on around me. I feel like I don't even know who God is! What if I'm wrong? What if I don't know Him? It's all very scary. The implications are serious. So I'm basically freaking out.   Thank you in advance for anyone who is reading this.

First of all, I'd assess if you are losing faith in God or in religion. I'm not religious, but I still have faith in a higher power. I'm not against religion In any way, but I don't think you can be told who or what God is, it's something you have to figure out for yourself. My beliefs are kind of a mixture of Abrahamic and Buddhist, so I'm not entirely sure if we'd see eye to eye, but I think the best way to strengthen your faith is by doing everyday things. Do what you love, talk to people you love, go on walks or meditate. These things all help me. See, I'm fairly open to what God is, but I think God is a part of us all. It's like the way people argue rather you should love God or your family more, I think really, you don't have to pick favourites or put one above the other. See, I think God is part of everything and everyone. My advice is to have faith in yourself, and in your family, as they will help you find faith in God, and God can also help you find faith in your loved ones and yourself.

If you've encountered this viewpoint, please be informed by this passage from Moses' writings in Deuteronomy, which is strongly and clearly monotheistic. First, I'll give the key verse, then the context:  **Key verse:**  ""know therefore today, and lay it to your heart, that the LORD/YHWH is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other."" Deuteronomy 4:39 \(ESV\)  **Context:**  ""Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live? Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great deeds of terror, all of which the LORD/YHWH your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? To you it was shown, that you might know that the LORD/YHWH is God; there is no other besides him. Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you. And on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire. And because he loved your fathers and chose their offspring after them and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power, driving out before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day, know therefore today, and lay it to your heart, that the LORD/YHWH is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.""

I have zero experience with these substances personally but am interested in therapeutic use of MDMA from a research perspective. I'm also curious if psychedelics might be used as tools for legitimate spiritual enhacement at some point in the future.","I can't speak to the spiritual aspects, but I took more than my share of LSD in college and had a great time doing so.  Maybe the coolest part was going to a Primus concert on acid.   Honestly the best option is mushrooms (psilocybin). They were hard to come by where I lived but the few times I partook they really enhanced mood and perception, without making you feel intoxicated or like you were tripping.  No hangover of any sort, if they were legal I'd probably partake on occasion even in middle age.","My time to shine.  I have become *intensely* interested in entheogenic usage over the last year and a half or so. Last year I decided to do a salvia divinorum (which *is not for beginners*) and create a ritual for myself based off of the Kirtland temple endowment ceremony. You can read about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/d75ucz/my_entheogenic_mormon_experience/). I have since continued this practice periodically and my attitudes have shifted a bit. Joseph Smith likely dosed people by spiking the sacrament right before an endowment ceremony. When I take psychedelics exclusively for spiritual exploration and growth I like to think of it as a ""Endowment-Communion"". It is distinct from normal sacrament in that entheogens are an element. It is an entirely distinct ritual from sacrament because of this different.  That link also has some links to some of the best research on the Smith-Entheogen theory (a term coined by /u/NakedMormonism). If you're interested, [I would check out Sunstone Symposium this year.](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/2020-schedule/) There's like 3 presentations on the Smith-Entheogen theory.  There is an undeniable shift happening right now. The greater western world is starting to realize that the War On Drugs was basically a sham. We're learning more and more that psychedelics are a powerful spiritual tool. Hell, even within our own tradition there's evidence of them. The general attitudes towards psychedelics in the western world are shifting so much that Netflix is releasing documentaries on positive uses of psychedelics.  That said, if you're inexperienced with these things you should ***REALLY*** adhere to [the 6 S's](https://thethirdwave.co/set-setting-lsd/). These are things that can set you up for a life-changingly positive experience, or a life-changing negative experience. You are very vulnerable when you trip, and you want to try and minimize as many things that could cause it to go awry.   Anyway, if you have *any* questions I would be happy to give some advice.  To preface, no I am not a hookup for psychedelics and never will be. If you don't know where to find them, go make friends with people who go to music festivals.

[Matthew] 21:10-11, he is still ‚Äòthe prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.‚Äô  But later (cf.

The Marcan explanation makes his action seem even more irrational, for he should have known better than to expect to find such fruit at Passover.‚Äù (Daniel J. Harrington, 1990, p. 620)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶ it has been asked, ‚Äòhow could our Lord expect to find *ripe* figs in the end of *March*?‚Äô  Answer, because figs were *ripe* in Judea as early as the *passover*.  Besides, the fig-tree puts forth its fruit *first*, and afterward its leaves.  Indeed this tree, in the climate which is proper for it, has fruit on it all the year round, as I have often seen.  All the difficulty in the text may be easily removed by considering that the *climate* of *Judea* is widely different from that of *Great Britain*.  The *summer* begins there in *March*, and the *harvest* at the passover, as all travellers into these countries testify: therefore as our Lord met with this tree five days *before* the passover, it is evident, 1st. That it was the *time* of *ripe* figs; and 2dly. That it was *not* the *time* of *gathering* them, because this did not begin till the *passover*, and the transaction here mentioned took place *five* days before.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶ this tree was intended to point out the *state* of the *Jewish people*.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶ our Lord‚Äôs conduct toward this tree is to be considered as *emblematical* of the treatment, and final perdition which was to come upon this hypocritical and ungodly nation. ‚Ä¶ It was a *proper* time for them to have borne *fruit*‚Ä¶ and if it did not produce such, the tree should be hewn down by the Roman axe.‚Äù (Adam Clarke, 1831, v I, p. 305)   &amp;nbsp;    -**14**. And he responded and said unto it,    ‚ÄúA man will not [◊ú◊ê, *Lo‚Äô*] eat from you fruit until [the] world!‚Äù    And heard, his students.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**12-14**. ‚Ä¶ The Fourth Gospel has a different view; cf. also Matt. 21:14.  Luke omits both this section and the sequel, 11:20-25.  It has sometimes been thought to be an ‚Äòacted parable‚Äô (Luke 13:6-9), or in the older, anti-Jewish exegesis, a symbol of the rejection of Judaism or a mystical prophecy of the fall of Jerusalem.  The explanation **for it was not the season for figs** (omitted by Matthew) only increases the problem, as it reflects upon the good sense of Jesus.  Some commentators view it as a later gloss.  Has it some connection with the meaning of Bethphage ‚Äì ‚ÄòHouse of *unripe* figs‚Äô?‚Äù (Frederick C. Grant, 1951, vol. VII p. 828)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúThe cursing of the fig tree‚Ä¶ is curious on several counts: it destroys property (see 5:1-20); and Jesus‚Äô behavior seems irrational and destructive.  Mark understood the cursing and its fulfillment (11:20-21) as an act of power done by Jesus, but perhaps the pre-Marcan tradition had transformed a parable told by Jesus (see Luke 13:6-9) into a story about Jesus.  The symbolic level of the story focuses on Israel‚Äôs lack of readiness to accept Jesus (or more likely, his message of the kingdom).‚Äù (Daniel J.

The insistence on the certainty that prayers will be answered seems to have been part of Jesus‚Äô distinctive teaching (see Matt 7:7-11; Luke 11:9-13).‚Äù (Daniel J.

That something like this saying was current in the oral tradition, or in Q [a hypothetical source], a detached saying is clear from Matt. 17:20 and Luke 17:6; but as a rule of prayer it sounds strange in this connection, and resembles a magical prescription ‚Äì like the rule of the ancient rabbi, in Fiebig‚Äôs *J√ºdische Wundergeschichten* [Jewish Miracle Stories] (p. 20), who knew that his prayer was heard whenever it was ‚Äòfluent in his mouth.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ The hyperbole in vs. 23 is undoubtedly conscious and illustrative; it is corrected and reduced to a principle in vs. 24.‚Äù (Frederick C.

Vs. 26 is absent from a strong group of MSS (◊ê, B W sys sa bo, etc.), and although its omission may be accounted for by homoeoteleuton^6 , it is more probable, since Matthew omits both vss. 2 and 26, that the whole of vss. 25-26 is an interpolation based on Matt. 6:13-15.  **Your Father ‚Ä¶ who is in heaven** and **forgive you your trespasses** are simply not Marcan expressions, but are thoroughly characteristic of Matthew.  The fact that the Syriac (sys) contains vs. 25 may afford a clue to the way in which the interpolation took place; again and again this MS [manuscript] reflects the powerful influence of the text of Matthew upon that of Mark during the period down to, say, A.D. 325.

I've been taught that regeneration replaces circumcision, not baptism. Can anybody convince me of paedobaptism?","Sure, I'm down--- but there are about a million different ways to come at this conversation. I'll start here:  As a Presbyterian pastor, when I baptize an infant, I and adaptation use the Church of Scotland's liturgy, which is actually an adaptation on the French Reformed Liturgy. I say something like this:  [name], beloved child of God,  For you, God sent Jesus Christ into the world,  For you, Christ lived and showed your steadfast love  For you, Christ suffered the darkness of calvary,   and cried and the last it is accomplished  For you Christ triumphed over death and rose in newness of life,  For you Christ ascended to reign at God‚Äôs right hand.

Of course an 8 day old Hebrew child doesn't understand the law or the covenant, but his inclusion in that covenant is evidenced by an outward and communal sign. He belongs before he is capable of knowing it.  Baptism functions similarly. It is a theological claim that God chooses us before we can ever choose God. It helpfully identifies God as the primary agent in baptism as opposed to ""I decided to walk down the aisle and let Jesus into my heart.""  It's important to say that most Christian denominations that do practice paedobaptism have something called confirmation. This is usually a course of intense study during late middle school or junior high, wherein the person (having been baptized as a child) now takes on the faith of their own volition.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.2452405929

For example, I used to live next to some kind of ethnic ""Chinese Gospel Church."" I've heard of Korean immigrants doing something similar.  Meanwhile, at least in my experience, it seems that Hispanics are integrated better into Protestant churches and Roman Catholic parishes, and that in general the Roman Catholic Church tends to integrate immigrants of different backgrounds into one church (except when, of course, those people self-segregate and live in different neighborhoods).  Of course, I think none of these churches *try* to be exclusive of people of other races/ethnicities, but putting your ethnic/national group in your name can give a sense of exclusivity to outsiders, and sometimes these churches do other things (often unintentionally, I presume) that make it *de facto* impossible for outsiders to feel welcome there.  My question is: is this unbiblical? Is it wrong to set up a ""Chinese Gospel Church"" or an ""Armenian Orthodox Church"" or a ""Polish Catholic Church"" in your area? Or is there something that we could/should do to help immigrants from different backgrounds to integrate into existing non-ethnic churches?

We humans hate not being in control. We hate being unable to control our destinies. We hate being unable to control our circumstances. We hate the idea that some horrible thing might happen to us tomorrow without warning. Humans have a way to cope with this fear though. Believing in God gives a sense of order and indirect control.   The idea that nothing is ultimately in control is upsetting, but the belief that there is an omnipotent, all-knowing, and moral person controlling everything is comforting. You might not be in direct control, but it feels great to know someone competent (and who's more competent than God?) is at the wheel. Even if your life is rife with challenges, you can believe they're just tests to make you a better person so you'll appreciate heaven more when you die. The idea of heaven is part of this sense of control. To die is to lose control completely, but the idea that you live on in a better world gives a sense of control.   Not only will you live on in paradise, but your enemies who disbelieve in the true God will burn in hell. Again, this idea gives a sense of control and order. The wicked will pay for their evil deeds, and you will reap goodness and peace. The alternative is very upsetting. The alternative is that there is no afterlife and evil people often get away with their bad deeds. This is extremely disconcerting to the mind. This is chaotic. Nobody is at the wheel of the universe in this situation.  People often try to divorce this sense of control and order from a personal God with the idea of karma. Karma is this mysterious force that gives the feeling of order and control and justice. The evil person will eventually get his comeuppance, and the good person will be rewarded. This is a very comforting and encouraging idea and people often believe in it for that reason alone.",Maybe for some people but not everybody.  It could be the otherway around for other people where the put the controlin the hands of god; they dont need to activity concern themselves with that part of life.  Then for others it could be just something that seems/sounds plausible to them.,"&gt;Karma is this mysterious force that gives the feeling of order and control and justice.      Eh, close. Karma is simply cause and effect.

I am not sure if it would be fair to say that the U.S. Constitution was based on the Presbyterian Book of Order. I'm not sure if the first Presbytery in the U.S. (Philadelphia) even called their constitution the Book of Order.   That being said, there is indeed a direct connection between Presbyterians and representative democracy as we know it, and it really starts before the Mayflower. John Calvin formed a representative system in Geneva to lead the church, that made its way to Scotland via John Knox, the Church of Scotland influenced the development of British Parliament (William of Orange), some persecution influenced some Scottish Presbyterians to move to Ireland and then on to America. This immigrant population is referred to as the ""Scotch-Irish.""   There were a lot of factors that went into the American Revolution and the writing of the U.S. Constitution, but one of them was most certainly due to Presbyterian influence. The desire for representation and a balance of power that cuts across class divisions is at the core of our church government to this day.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.7511241245

I recognize that to a large extent it may be semantic and philosophical, but anyways...  Bahais believe that God sends messengers, like mirrors reflecting the sun. We call them Manifestations of God. Semantically, this sounds like the messengers are God, but more expressions of God rather than God Himself. We believe the messengers to be both human and divine.  Christian belief, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that Jesus was human and divine, but was actually God Himself. Wikipedia suggests the semantic difference is that Jesus was an ""incarnation"" of God. Very nearly the same but still not quite.  It's hard for me to articulate or even wrap my head around this subtlety.   Anyone have references or clarification? Other ways to think about it that might be easier?   Also - Jesus is believed to be Savior of the World, that heaven was only opened to humanity after his death and resurrection. What is the Baha'i belief?","Well, no one else here yet so you get my take. This is only my opinion, and has no scholarly basis outside my own life experience and readings of various scriptures.  Basically, the difference is that Christians believe Christ's status to be unique. I do not, nor do the Baha'is afaik.  To a Christian, unity with God is exclusive to Christ, and a state that we the people are inherently cut off from as 'sinners'. Other 'prophets' are seen to receive special insight from the divine, but not regarded as divine themselves.  I think Baha'i ontology agrees with my own personal belief that unity with the divine is a basic fact of existence, something intrinsic to all that is. 'Original Sin' makes that position untenable for Christians, and so Christ is seen as the only person to ever be one with God. Thus, he occupies a station we the faithful could never aspire to, much less achieve.  That's the difference as far as I know, but I know little so take what truth you find here and discard the rest as you please. Be well.",I couldn't agree more!

Trying to keep it short, went to an overly strict catholic school as a kid, didnt fit right with me so went to public school a bit before high school. Anywho, Ive always wanted to be able to want to go to church or have a belief in something, but I am well, stubborn and consider myself agnostic. However, I've seen what believing in something does to people. Heck, even though the convos are awkward with my super religious neighbors, I wish I had the life and marriage they do (going through divorce atm myself) - nothing thrown at them in life phases them, and the bond and love they share is unreal. This also applies to their general good nature and overall being great people. Life seems to be a little idk.. caustic right now with everything going on, so I just wanted maybe some of ya'lls stories or maybe a point in the direction (i love books etc) on how it happened for you guys. Thanks!","Hi,   I don't know how much insight I have, but I wanted to try to answer your question as best I could. I answer in my own terms below, but I wanted to send you this link which I think greatly addresses what you are talking about. It is Andy Stanley talking about Easter. I really think you would enjoy watching it and it would make you think.  http://northpoint.org/messages/history-mystery/  I was raised in church, but I have certainly questioned my own faith as I have gotten older. I asked myself why I believed what I do and I do think that for me it goes beyond something like ""I believe because my parents did."" At times, I still question, of course, and I don't think that is a bad thing. I think about it a lot, actually.  One thing, for me, is that people often assume that it is automatically so unlikely that there is a God. If I think about that, though, it seems just as unlikely to me that everything just formed on its own through mere chance. Its like it comes down to either God or luck that we are all here through an incredibly long and complex chain of unlikely events, not the least of which is that reality itself exists at all. I don't really see that luck or chance is any more ""likely"" than God. Either way, it is very amazing we are here at all, that anything is here at all, and God is just far more compelling to me than ""luck.""   Also, if the things that are the best of us--love, true friendship, compassion, hope, sacrifice, mercy--are nothing more than devices to promote the propagation of our species, then to me, they are rather meaningless. In turn, life itself would be meaningless to me.   Anyway, maybe you can get something out of this. Feel free to write if you'd like to discuss it.   Have a great day,  A. J.","Well, I have had my faith since I was a kid. My father was a drug addict. He was hardly around when I was growing up, but he would take me stay with him every few months. He would tell me bedtime stories and they were always about God. They wete different stories in the Bible that my father remembered. Mainly I remember the story he told me about Job. (You should check it out when you get a chance.)     Anyways, these stories amazed me, in the way any kid would be by listening to his father tell him about a holy man who would always love and protect him. These teaching stood w me always. And I think my father opened me up to living with a strong faith.    There have also been moments in my life. These moments are very hard to describe in text.     The first happened in high school, during tardy sweep, which is basically detention. It was held in the gym. About 100 kids were present. It was quiet and early. Everyone was sleepy. Out of nowhere a kid jumps up, and he starts yelling about God. He starts saying that the world is in danger, and that we must have faith. He asks for anyone with faith to stand. He wanted us to claim it. I looked around at all the other kids as he spoke. No one stood up. I waited for them to but before I could think I was standing. I just had to, and I was astounded that nobody else did. I was scared but I had to stand. And that was the first time I felt that feeling. It was like fire, intense, heart racing, unique, euphoria. Eventually he nodded at me and we sat down.    The second time was also in high school. I was in class talking to girl I really liked. She was telling me about how she didn't know if she believed in God, because her life apparently sucked. And I told her the story of Job. After the first few words the same feeling from the cafeteria hit me. And I told her the whole story in the midst tears, struggling w each word. And she was teary eyed by the end. She ended being my first love. And my first sexual partner.    The third time was after high school. I was in my car, driving home after a long night of drinking. I pulled into my driveway as a song came on the radio. I listened to it and cried like a baby as the same feeling washed over me. (I forgot the name but search.  I will dance for you jesus) I'm an alcoholic and the song crushed me after thinking about where I was at that point in life.    I still feel like crying sometimes. Life still sucks. But hope in God is all I have. That feeling I had those three times and a few other times is all I have for proof that he is with me. It's enough for me. I hope you can experience something like it one day.    I never doubted that love as a boy. I never questioned God until I became an adult and witnessed sadness in the world. It's difficult to believe in something so fantastical as God but if I didn't I would have given up already. Best of luck to you friend.",comment_2,"Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,

It wasn‚Äôt gossip or Freemason curse heredity that stopped them from being healed, it was that they hadn‚Äôt done what he wanted them to do yet.

The paper used in this manuscript is solid and of average thickness. It gained a brown colouration over time. A distinctive colour of the manuscripts from this era.

I hope someone here will see my questions and lead me to some light, it looks like there's not been activity here for awhile.   I'm an exCatholic, spiritually thirsty, and there is a PCUSA church right down the street from me. Being socially progressive, I've many times admired the social justice stances of the church, and have considered many a Sunday walking to my local fellowship.  I have had 2 reservations, questions really, that I hope to clarify before visiting locally.  First, I'm wondering if the PCUSA (or any Presbyterian denomination for that matter) has ever officially apologized or made a public statement of regret regarding [John Calvin's role in having Michael Servetus burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus)?   In the wiki article it says that in europe on 3 October 2011, Geneva erected a statue of Michael Servetus. ""R√©my Pagani, former mayor of Geneva, inaugurated the statue.... Representatives from the Roman Catholic Church in Geneva and the Director of Geneva's International Museum of the Reformation attended the ceremony. A Geneva newspaper noted the absence of officials from the National Protestant Church of Geneva, the church of John Calvin.""  This leads me to believe no Presbyterian Church has expressed any regret over this historic travesty which seems sad to me. I would love though if someone can show me that my notion is incorrect.  Secondly, probably many here have had this question asked them before, I'm curious about predestination. Not generally, I've read plenty and get the general idea. Actually what I'm specifically wondering about is individual theological freedom of conscience and a preference of universalism over predestination....if I visit and then become a member of the church down the street, and a lifelong member of the PCUSA, could I believe/proclaim in Bible studies/endorse the tenant that..Anne Frank and all the Jews who died in the Holocaust say, are just as likely to be in heaven as anyone else? Would I be a fish out of water? What's the bottom line on this compared to the denomination's culture? I'm guessing due to the socially progressive culture of the denomination, there must also be theologolical wiggle room or freedom of individual conscience? Is there a staunch predestination expected of all members, is there any official statement of the church which says something to the effect of, ""we officially believe a vast majority of humanity will not be saved BUT individually you don't have to subscribe to it""? If there's no such official statement, is there at least this sort of lax sentiment in the church culturally?   Thank you in advance for any help. These 2 items seem like deal breakers to me, and I don't feel I can visit the church without resolving these in my conscience.","Hi fellow ex-cath with a strange draw to PC(USA)! I‚Äôm an active member of my congregation (for the past 7 years) and elder who is discerning seminary in the PC(USA). Just a bit of background so you know who you‚Äôre talking to. Now on to your questions!  Re: apology for Calvin, I don‚Äôt know of any official apology that has happened. Doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt one, of course, but I just don‚Äôt know. To be truthful, in the daily life of a congregation were largely so far removed from Calvin that he basically never comes up. Except for those few occasions when he‚Äôs mentioned on say reformation Sunday, or those times when we make fun of him for being such a jerk.  It‚Äôs also the case that, while our theology and polity may have grown out of Calvin‚Äôs thought (among others, most importantly John Knox for the US), we really have no connection to him directly. He‚Äôs not ‚Äúours‚Äù in the way that Luther is to the Lutherans, for example. That doesn‚Äôt excuse what the church in Geneva did (or rather didn‚Äôt do), and we should be clear in our condemnation of some of the actions Calvin took, but we‚Äôre farther removed from him (which is why we identify as ‚Äúreformed‚Äù and not ‚ÄúCalvinist‚Äù).  And that sort of gets to your second concern, that of predestination. While it is true that reformed theology still teaches double predestination, as a member (and especially as a non-member attendee) you are absolutely not required to assent to that. Jesus is lord of the conscience, as the saying goes. Depending on your congregation, they could be stricter if you want to teach bible school, but that‚Äôs a local thing. Same with being ordained as a deacon, elder, or minister. While I am personally hopeful for universal salvation, I recognize that who is or is not saved is not up to me, it is entirely God‚Äôs prerogative. In the end I will find out, and as I‚Äôll be with God, I have a feeling that whatever the truth is will be fine.  One last thing to give you food for thought. In my PC(USA) congregation I have found a community that has nourished my spiritual life more than I ever thought possible, so much that I can safely say they are one of the biggest earthly reasons I am discerning entering seminary. In the end, we‚Äôre all a bunch of people trying our best to get it right, with each other and with God. We mess up, we cry, we laugh, we share each other‚Äôs joy and sorrow. I wouldn‚Äôt trade my congregation for any other, in any denomination. Like any denomination, some congregations are better than others, but that‚Äôs a reflection on people, not on the church.  I‚Äôll close with a line I‚Äôm stealing from the Episcopalians: ‚ÄúThe PC(USA) Welcomes You‚Äù  Edit: oops! Almost forgot the requisite predestination joke - you were predestined to join PC(USA), may as well get good with that fact :-P","Thank you for such a kind and warm-hearted response to my questions and welcoming me. What you have said is very encouraging and confirms my thought that culturally the pcusa must be as progressive culturally as it is social justice wise. Especially what got me is when you said of John Calvin ""those times when we make fun of him for being such a jerk"" and also how it's different than say how Lutheran's may view Luther. Big relief.  My universalism isn't just an ideal of conscience to me but also a personal emotional factor as I have deceased relatives I was very close to who have died and were not Christians. It would insult their memory to go to a church which officially taught they were in hell forever, predestined or not. I though about liberal Quaker or Unitarian but as I said in my intro, a pcusa church is walking distance from me. So, I'm encouraged when you say that there is a cultural freedom of conscience in the church depending upon the local congregation.   I don't suppose in many denominations anyone would be a stickler about the bottom line if I expressed a universalist view here and there. I'm somewhat guarded against that bottom line though I suppose. When I left Catholicism I went to a nondenominational church briefly. At first it seemed casual, open, not doctrinally strict or rigid. But then I began overhearing people conversing about the unsaved going to hell, then I began hearing it preached regularly from the pulpit.  You say that it's perhaps unlikely I'd find myself free to teach universalism in a Sunday school class. What I understand you to mean is that the pcusa does officially teach that a majority go to hell, and I could fit in if I didn't express otherwise to the extent of rocking the boat?   I'm sorry if it seems I'm hyperfocused on this one issue or seeming to split hairs. I have a special bookcase in my bedroom. On the top shelf I have 3 framed pictures. Anne Frank, my grandfather, and my brother...the latter 2 having died atheists. It would grieve my conscience horribly if I were to allow myself to become involved in a church that officially tought these 3 were in hell for eternity. I suppose what I mean to say is that I have a line drawn in the sand of my conscience, and while I appreciate the church has an openess culturally, I'm wondering if I would be rather alone in my universalism, and to what extent that possible Sunday School drama may play out in other ways. What if for example, a few years from now I as a pcusa member were to publish a Presbyterian devotional with universalist ideals, or began some sort of Presbyterian universalist ministry or printing press or magazine or like you, feel called to the seminary but then preach universalism from the pulpit?   I'm not leery of reprimand. I'm leery of feeling my view is the compassionate one in a tribe of people who at least officially on paper adhere to a less compassionate one. Even if it were never discussed, the knowing itself would injure me. At the end of the day, before bed, I face these three pictures on my shelf. Joining a church whose fine print condemned them to hell would make me feel I was betraying good, even if no one at church every rubbed my nose in the fine print or chastised me with it.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.1103546644

However, my parents and future in-laws are very Christian, and my future in-laws are pushing to have pre-buffet dinner grace at our wedding. We have both said no several times (I have honestly never been to a wedding with grace said and feel like it is awkward with the buffet style), but they have been guilt-tripping us and have not left us with a graceful way to say no anymore. We created a blessing we are comfortable with where we give thanks generally, but they sent us a script they want us to use. I'm not comfortable with the grandiosity and highly religious contents. This is not the first thing they are pushing us on with the wedding, but it is one of the first times they are not accepting 'no'. They have brought my parents into this by saying they're sure that my parents really want grace said as well.  Is there a kind and inclusive way to do things? For the record: we are paying for and organizing the wedding ourselves, and my future father-in-law is already planning to do a sermon during the ceremony. I was hoping that would be enough for them. I would like to maintain a good relationship with them, as family is very important to us.  As a final note: going forward, we are a little concerned about potential kids - as a child I was often very forcefully told that I was going to hell if I didn't believe in the Bible being literally true, and given the amount of pushiness we have encountered so far about the wedding, I am hoping to establish good boundaries now.  I'm making this post within this subreddit because I don't want anger or vitriol about religion. I'm hoping to get nuanced opinions about how to handle this and potential future encounters.","Man what a drag, what is your wife saying here?  I guess you are both agnostic? As rude as your in-laws seem to be, and you still have a certain amount of respect and love for them, perhaps just let them pray their prayer.

I agree that these testimonies are of value, and I try to work towards refining my personal character using them as a guide.   I try to remember the testimonies, but usually don't if I'm caught up in something that runs counter to their ethical basis. For example, I might find myself becoming impatient with someone, and in turn might be a little rude to them. Even if I'm not rude, I feel the impatience and internal upset, perhaps even after it's all said and done. It isn't until I reflect after the fact (if I happen to reflect), that I consider how nonsensical my behavior or emotional response likely was.  I grew tired of this being the case, because it started to feel like I wasn't improving myself in action so much as acknowledging there was room for improvement. So I asked my fiancee to make me a bracelet to act as a reminder.   The bracelet symbolizes S.P.I.C.E., and here's how:  S - It's made of string. Nothing more. It's very simple and unassuming.  P - The string is blue. According to color psychology, blue is the color of peace.   I - It just so happens that blue is also the color of integrity.   C - The bracelet is actually made of two strings that have been braided together, symbolizing community.  E - The string is wrapped twice around the wrist, side-by-side, symbolic of equality.   This has been helping me a great deal. Because I see it, it makes me pause and focus on its meaning, and relate it to the situation at hand.

God created humans (either directly or, as I believe, through evolution) with free will, and He gave us a very privileged position in Creation: we are her (Creation's) steward. That means that we, both as individuals and collectively, are mystically united with the world around us. And when we chose to sin, it affected God's ability to interact with us -- sin is, at its heart, an inclination of the heart to replace the will of God with its own will, and since God gave us free will, if we want to disobey Him, He has chosen not to interfere. Why? Because if we didn't have free will, we wouldn't really be able to love God -- you wouldn't call it love if you hypnotized someone and married her or him. So we choose to limit, and often times negate, any influence of God on our own wills. This has ramifications for Creation, since we are her stewards: when we are ""out of whack,"" so is she. This is why there are, for example, terrible storms, or earthquakes: we have cast God's influence out of the weather systems, and chaos -- and ultimately, emptiness -- reign wherever God has been turned aside.  I firmly believe that the Roman Catholic Church, as embodied in Her faithful and their servants, the priests, the bishops, and the Supreme Pontiff, is, on the whole, the most assured path to a good life -- whether it is correct or not, I'm not sure, and I'm fairly certain that God has mercy on those who walk along more difficult paths towards Him. But I also believe that, while on the whole the Church can never ""fall to the gates of Hell,"" that is, the Church's emphasis can be very incorrect, and we don't understand everything perfectly yet, but we know what is necessary for Salvation, and we're learning more all the time. I feel, however, that, as a grace from God, I have been called to question some Church teachings in my conscience -- that place wherein God talks to human, teaching her, guiding her, simply being with her. And when He is with me, when I am blessed to open up to His Word, I cannot find rest in the idea that, for instance, a woman can't act in the person of Christ as an ordained minister. I do not reconcile the differences; it is the Holy Spirit within me, and while I have to cooperate with Her work in me in order to be fruitful, it is Her work, not mine, that leads me -- and I know I may have strayed far.

Do you have any worthiness interviews where members must affirm adherence to commandments? Does your church have special ordinances that can only be carried out in secret, or in a temple to be considered valid?","My experience is entirely within the Brighamite branch of mormonism. I am curious about your church because it seems progressive on every front where the LDS church seems to be way behind the overall societal curve. From what I've been able to determine, from study alone, *The Community of Christ* should be counted among the most liberal of Christian churches.  With that as background, I am most curious about the questions in the title. Brighamite mormons are extremely secretive and are loathe to even talk about what goes on in their temple services. Your Independence and Kirtland Temples are open to the public. The Brighamites find this strange because of their long history of secret temple rites. The reasons for Brighamite secrecy trace to Masonic origins. The rites introduced at Nauvoo were intended to offer a similar experience as those found in the Masonic lodges of the day. Some have also put forward a more sinister reason for imposing secrecy was to hide Smith's polygamy, and the multiple marriages of those he allowed to learn about his doctrine of Celestial marriage. Because polygamy was against the law, the rites began with oaths of secrecy that (at least in their initial form) provided for a gruesome death penalty if violated. I know your church has never practiced polygamy, but does your church practice any form of a temple endowment ritual? From what I gather from the official website, there is an endowment, but it is similar to the baptismal confirmation that I am most familiar with. I don't think your church has ever had a nude bathing initiation rite, as formerly practiced by the Brighamites, but I could be wrong. Smith practiced *washing of feet* in Kirtland, and I assume that some of the later rituals evolved from there. Is it your church's position that some (or all of) the Nauvoo temple rituals were introduced in error?  Thanks in advance for any comment.","Thank you for the questions.  I start work shortly, and hope to be able to follow up more later this evening.  &gt;does your church practice any form of a temple endowment ritual?   No to all of the questions above.  The only ordinance we practice at the temple is the sacrament of the Lord's Supper - Communion.  All the others are practiced in the local congregations.  *All* are welcome to worship with us, at the Temple, and everywhere else.","To follow up a bit, the Community of Christ shared a common 14 year period of history with the Mormons, but its members reflect the church more as it was in New York and Kirtland, than as it developed in Nauvoo.  We treasured the instruction that Joseph read in James 1:5, and feel called to become a prophetic people.    This means that the beliefs of each person are their own responsibility according to their own relationship with God.  The Churches' role is to invite, but not to determine for them.  This is how we understand being a non creedal church.  The proper roll of the church is not to judge, but to love God's creation in community.  As a institution, we feel called to Christ's mission to build the Kingdom.

She only goes to mass sometimes, and receives Holy Communion. I talk sometimes about my faith with her, but I have the new revert zeal that can come across a bit harsh, and she is dismissive of my statements about following precepts of the Church. Therefore, I dont know how to handle when we do go to Mass, and she does receive. If I say ""You really shouldn't receive until you go to confession."" It is very likely she wouldn't agree, say I'm being extreme and receive anyway. I don't know what to do, and I'm worried.  Should I change my approach? Be more active, try and live out the Gospels, sometimes using words, and continue to pray for her return? Or should I try and be more hardline in my responses?",First approach. And offer the opportunity to go to confession too.,Love her.  She's your mother.  Use a light touch.,comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.2416572972
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/ExploreReligion.jsonl,ExploreReligion.jsonl,16hbab,Religion and violence: Are there situations where physical violence is justified?,"I'm curious what people's position on physical violence is. Some people's position may be based entirely on religion, and others' positions might have nothing to do with their religion. I imagine that most people think that violence in self-defense is justified, but I'm not sure that this particular view has anything to do with religion.   When do you think physical violence justified? Is there a difference between personal (e.g., a one-on-one situation) and large-scale conflicts (i.e., war)? Are your views on physical violence informed by your religion? And if so, please give some details. That is, what are the religious views and even specific sources that inform those views.  This might be a tricky topic, so please make extra efforts to keep the discussion open and civil (see the sidebar).","Physical violence in Islam is only justified in the context of self-defense on a personal or state level or as a punishment for crimes. If someone attacks me, I have the right to defend myself. In the context of an Islamic state, if we are driven from our homes or prevented from worshipping, we have the right to defend ourselves. This is based upon the fact that there were Muslims who were driven out of their homes and tortured in Mecca for practicing Islam.   In war, only combatants are to be attacked, never civilians, and property is not to be damaged, not even a tree.   I should note that none of this (except personally defending yourself) can be done without a Caliphate. The Muslims in Mecca never fought back. They only fought back when there was a Muslim state in Medinah.   Edit: I should mention that punishments can only be carried out in an Islamic state, by a judge or someone appointed by a judge, after acceptable proof has been provided. The examples we see of stoning people today is wrong. I have no idea how they justify that. The proof is practically impossible to provide, and there is no Islamic state.","One of the central texts in Hinduism is the Bhagavad Gita. It starts out with Arjuna, a warrior, standing on a battlefield. A great war is about to begin, and he draws his chariot between the two armies, to see who has come to fight. The war is an internecine conflict, so Arjuna has beloved family members and teachers on both sides, and he knows there is no way the war will end with all of his loved ones still living.   Arjuna tells his friend and chariot driver, Krishna, (who is God), that he doesn't want to engage in the battle. Arjuna says, ""I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness. Of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness, or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield... why should I wish to kill [these opponents], even though they might otherwise kill me?"" (Chapter 1, Verses 31-35)  Arjuna then makes an argument for pacifism. He says that it would be sinful to slay these kinsmen. Even though they may be overcome with greed and see no fault in killing one's family or quarreling with friends, that doesn't mean we should respond in the same way. If we do, it will result in the degradation of society, and no good can come of it. Arjuna decides that it would be better to be killed than to engage in this war. (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1, Verses 36-46).  Krishna convinces Arjuna to fight. One of his central arguments is that, as a warrior and a king, it is Arjuna's duty to defend his people against aggressors. Krishna also explains to Arjuna that an individual living entity is not killed when the body is killed - just like we remove yesterday's clothes and put on clean clothes for a new day, when this body is worn out and dies, we are born into a new body. So we should not lament so much for the loss of this body. And, whether we stay in this body, or die and move to another body, it is all determined by our karma.   **In summary**, there are two points from this: (1) Defense of yourself and others against aggressors is proper; (2) Death is not the great tragedy we tend to think it is.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.4966363455

One critique of Islam I've come across is in regards to its foundation. Around 7th century A.D., there were still sects of Gnostic Christians that held some of the exact views found in the Qur'an (most notably regarding the crucifixion and divinity of Jesus/Isa).   The claim often used by Christians and atheists s that Muhammad (PBUH) picked up these beliefs during his time as a merchant and just incorporated them into Islam.  Are there any good counterarguments to these claims from an Islamic point of view?  Link to the discussion I found this claim in: https://forums.catholic.com/t/islam-gnosticism-connection/129854","These are all just assumptions. The Quran is the last revelation of God, therefore it‚Äôll confirm what has come in the past and what is here to stay.   And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being called a Christian heretic if it means you‚Äôre a Muslim. I‚Äôm a proud disbeliever in a religion that states God can become a man and had to commit suicide for our sins.   And if they want to say Islam is ‚ÄúChristian heresy‚Äù, then Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) is a Christian heretic because he too was a Muslim, i.e. someone who surrenders and submits their will to God, not someone who necessarily followed Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) since Jesus came before him.  Matthew 26:39 - Jesus prostrates on the ground like a Muslim  John 5:30 - Jesus himself can do nothing, and all he wants to do is please the One who sent him (God)   Mark 12:29 - Jesus explains the most important commandment to follow is to worship the Lord as One, not a trinity   These are just a few verses to show that their claims are weak and nothing to worry about.","You could really go after the isolation argument. Not only was Muhammad PBUH an unlettered man who had never left Mecca (except if you include the reports of one not-authentic hadith) until he went to Madina, many years into prophethood. Furthermore, if you actually do historical research, you'll find that central arabs were fairly disconnected to any kind of Christianity, with the Bible never even having been translated into the Arabic language up until this point.  If you really go based on historical reports and what we have recorded about the life of the prophet, it's impossible to conclude that he copied part of the religion from other religions like Christianity.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.9555030581

While this statement would probably be confirmed by most members, the way we believe in it might be quite different than the way many LDS folk would understand.  Joseph Smith, Jr. is regarded with a very mixed view between different members.  His son, Joseph Smith III firmly stated that if his father had been involved with polygamy, (something his mother, Emma, denied when he asked her directly about it), it would have been wrong.  Modern president/prophets of the Church have bluntly stated that if any of Smith's teaching or actions differ from from those of Jesus, as a Church we follow Jesus Christ.  Beyond this, the Church does not mandate how we should believe, and there is a great range of difference between individual members.  The Church regards this diversity as a strength of the body.  In fact, we have a formal statement of disagreement, which states directly that disagreement with a church policy or teaching is not to be considered unfaithful.  One example of this is that some members don't believe in the historicity of the Book of Mormon or that it is an ancient record translated from golden plates.  Other members believe completely in the origin story that Joseph Smith, Jr. told.  The Church as an institution gives each member the freedom to decide for themselves and doesn't seek to dictate the way to believe.  As a result, answers to many questions along the line of ""What does the Church believe?"" on a given subject,  even if there is an answer, due, for example as a result of direct Conference action, should not be assumed to bind the agency of individuals to hold their own differing opinions.

What do you all think?","Personally, I find that the philosophical Problem of Evil generally only crops up in the Abrahamic traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam).   The problem arises when scripture/dogma butts heads with reality, since most of the Abrahamic sciptures posit a deity that is omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent - yet our senses clearly show us a world wherein evil (whether personal - as in, committed by a human with malicious intent - or impersonal - as in, a natural disaster happens, etc.) happens all the time. So, how to rectify the two? It's been awhile since I studied the ""Problem of Evil"" for a philosophy of religion class back in college (Comparative Religious Studies major here), but IIRC most Christian philosophy pares it down to either: 1) our senses are wrong (which, even the Christian theologians admit is *highly* unlikely), 2) God's power is limited (a.k.a. one of His omni's is just not omni enough), or 3) ""God works in mysterious ways"" (which I find to be a BS way of saying ""We don't have a good answer to this question"").  Personally, I feel that it boils down to a kind of ""theological schizophrenia"" in the Abrahamic traditions wherein they try to make a weird hybrid of personal and impersonal deity.   In most polytheistic religions, the deities are powerful, but *limited*. They're not omnipotent, omniscient, or omnipresent - nor are they always ""good"" in the human sense of the word and often times have conflicting and imperfect moral characters. Sometimes the multitudinous spirits/deities/etc. are working together, sometimes against one other, sometimes they're pursuing their own, individual objective and to hell with everyone else. This, in it's way, adequately explains the ""Problem of Evil"": there are multiple, imperfect powers at work in the Cosmos and they're not always on our side.  In more monistic religions (say Buddhism or Daoism), there *may* be something that is akin to omnipotent, omnipresent, etc., but it usually some kind of impersonal ""Ground of Being"" (e.g. Buddha-Mind, the Tao, etc.), which is definitively *not* anthropomorphic and should it have any kind of definable ""morality"" it's not necessarily going to be a *human* kind of morality. You will see some belief systems (e.g. Hinduism) where the polythestic and the monistic are attached together, but it's usually in a hierarchy: the impersonal Ground of Being is there, chillaxin' in the background while Cosmic reality arises, persists for a time, and then dissolves away all while the limited pantheon of deities are running about doing their thing in the foreground.  So, I'd say the connundrum arises when one tries to take a personal deity that humans can relate to (Yahweh, Jesus, etc.) and give it the abilities of an impersonal, ""Ground of Being""-type deity (omni-[insert trait here]). It's at that point when you get questions like: ""I don't understand: how can God be so loving and understanding of me and humanity, and be so powerful, but my child just got murdered through no fault of their own?""  Again, this is a personal take on the ""Problem of Evil"" and one's mileage may vary considerably from my own.","well i think, to be honest, that evil itself is a matter of perspective. it's just differing opinions to me on what is believed to be right by various opposing parties. so essentially, evil exists because humans gave a name to it.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.9079741774

I never bothered to register because I was always certain that I would move away at a moment's notice, so I didn't see the point. Well. As I say, 5 years have come and gone, and I'm still there. So I decided that now was the time to register. I'm a young adult, so I'd never registered before; my parents always handled that. So I decided to email the pastor to ask what was needed of me. I was polite and offered to meet him in person first so he could connect my name to my face. He responded with equal politeness and invited me to introduce myself and say hi to him after Mass on Sunday. So that's what I did. He was very, very nice, which wasn't shocking. What WAS shocking was that it was really clear to me that he found it unusual and was pleasantly surprised that I was bothering to introduce myself to him before just filling the form out.  At first, I felt embarrassed for being so extra and awkward, but gradually I've come to realize that I didn't do anything wrong or embarrassing. It's everyone else who ought to be embarrassed. Here's why:  Priests are supposed to be spiritual directors and respected members of the community. How are they supposed to fulfill those roles if people don't introduce themselves before registering, IF they register at all? He was also telling me that he used to schedule the First Communions on Mother's Day, but he was informed by several mothers that it was ""their day"" and that they were going to spend it in bed.  How rude is that?  There are places in the world where people can't go to Mass and/ or don't have access to a priest at all. I guess my point is that, at least in my neck of the woods, a serious cultural redress is needed with regard to how the priest is treated by his parishoners.  Let me be clear: I'm only speaking from my own personal experience here. I'm sure there are many parishes that treat their priests better than this, but this interaction made me so sad. And I don't want this cultural disease to spread, is all.","I think this is one of the crosses of the Parish Priest. It may stink, but politics are everywhere. The parish is no exception in pretty much every case.  The big donors threaten to pull their money if they don't get xyz. The hardcore Catholics threaten to speak badly to their inner circles if they don't get xyz. The various groups and councils in the Parish try to influence their desires into the Parish. Meanwhile the Priest is just trying to keep the peace and do their job as best as they can.  This emphasizes the need to pray for our Priests and to do exactly what you are doing, be kind and patient with them. I give my Priests a ""bro hug"" when I see them. I do love them for their sacrifice and their faith.","To be fair ""registering"" at a parish isn't necessary.  It's just for the parish's records.  Canonically, if you are Catholic and living in that parish's territory, you are automatically a member of that parish.  But it is sad people don't introduce themselves to their pastor.  Part of it is people seeing church as something they just go to on Sundays or they register to get their kids into the religious ed classes with no intention of actually going to Mass.  They don't see it as a community they're joining.  People just don't value their faith or see it as a big part of their lives.  They see themselves as Catholic and that's why they register or make their kids do First Communion, but it's such a small aspect of their life that they don't bother actually making it important.  And I think it is a problem in most places.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.1505696713

It is quite possibly one of the most eloquently arguments for atheism I have heard in a while.  While, Jefferson never came out as an atheist, I strongly believe he was a closet atheist.  The amazing thing about his argument is that he talks about how allowing athiest is *benificial* to religion.  (very sly tommy, very sly...)  I would reccomend that everyone read his article on religion  (you can find it here: http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefVirg.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=17&amp;division=div1 )  I would like to share my two favroite quotes from it:  The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be said, his testimony in a court of justice cannot be relied on, reject it then, and be the stigma on him. Constraint may make him worse by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him obstinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Reason and free enquiry are the only effectual agents against error. Give a loose to them, they will support the true religion, by bringing every false one to their tribunal, to the test of their investigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free enquiry, Christianity could never have been introduced. Had not free enquiry been indulged, at the aera of the reformation, the corruptions of Christianity could not have been purged away. If it be restrained now, the present corruptions will be protected, and new ones encouraged. Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now.  and  Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The several sects perform the office of a Censor morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thousand millions of people. That these profess probably a thousand different systems of religion. That ours is but one of that thousand. That if there be but one right, and ours that one, we should wish to see the 999 wandering sects gathered into the fold of truth. But against such a majority we cannot effect this by force. Reason and persuasion are the only practicable instruments. To make way for these, free enquiry must be indulged; and how can we wish others to indulge it while we refuse it ourselves.  Here are a few other random quotes (not from the same article) that shows that he wasa free thinker:  ""Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear.""  ""every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot...they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon, unintelligible to all mankind, and therefore the safer for their purposes.""  ""To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings.""  He fought for the seperation of church and state and fought against religious dogma (if even from behind a cover of christianity) and for this is he is my favroite president.  When people say our nation was founded on christian principals, I like to point to this man, the man on the nickle, $100 bill, and $2 bill. The man on mount rushmore.  The principal drafter of the delceration of independence, and 3rd president of the United States.  td;dr: Thomas Jefferson is boss.

Also, I think some things are sins more for our benefit than anything else. For example, I think waiting until marriage to have sex is to guarantee that we focus all of our love on one single person and also, by extension, make sure our hearts aren't so easily broken. So, if I knew FOR A FACT that my girlfriend and I were going to be together forever, I would see no problem with us having sex before marriage, as long as we were both ready for it. But the problem is that I can't know that, and we would both be devastated if we lost our virginity to each other and then broke up.

These are my thoughts now after many days and weeks of consideration and thought.","My God is not the same as your God. My understanding and interpretations of Jesus Christ's teachings and messages are different than yours.  I believe in evolution, quantum theory, human psychology, and advanced other scientific theories.  I believe in MY God, MY religion.  NOT Christianity, NOT Atheism, MY beliefs.  MINE.  I guess you could say it's a philosophy and a religious belief. I follow some Christian values and some Christian morals.  I disagree with Christianity in a lot of ways and don't believe in the same things as they do.  Atheism and Christianity both have some pros and cons.  I believe that there is a god and he dictates weather you go to Heaven or Hell based on your life.  However I believe he is fair and judges you as an overall person, if you‚Äôre humane.  Not on a rickety set of fucked up morals and beliefs Christians have.  You can not prove that some higher power, deity, or higher state of being exists; therefore I will keep believing it.  I think there can be a scientific for everything.  My belief is that god, for example, has not been around forever.  Like the natural fear of the dark, or fire, he has become ingrained in our psyche.  He is a belief in a higher power, a life after death.  In some studies about near death experiences (NDE) the people with that had some kind of NDE have seen some bright light, someone or something comforted them saying something along the lines of ""Now is not your time, go on."" or ""I do not need you yet, go home.""  Some higher power is ingrained into our psyche and is believed by most people.  Even in the smallest forms, believing in luck(good or bad), superstition, and even some paranormal activities.  These can be seen as life after death of some spiritual plane(stuck between Heaven and the Mortal plane(let's call the space we can inhabit that), or Hell and the Mortal plane).  Different dimensions possibly?  See, using science to explain religion.  God is an idea or belief in my opinion, or possibly a Spirit, or even some higher form of being.  If you have questions about my beliefs (probably not), want to point something out to me, or want to theorize or discuss I will be happy to!  Comment please! I love feedback! Your guys amaze me every time I log in!","Would you possibly describe yourself as an agnostic, or something more/less than that?","I think you need to stop going to /r/atheism and ask yourself first what is important to you and what *you* think of religion and why. You said you have but religious outlooks are something that are discovered over a lifetime, you shouldn't give up on it in weeks without very, very careful consideration about the validity of your beliefs.   /r/Atheism is truly a circle jerk that doesn't really present religious views very fairly before smashing down their strawmen. This is all coming from someone who is an atheist and really enjoys debating religion. /Atheism is *not* the place to find what you believe and why. It is a safe place for atheists to express their opinions. If you want to explore other areas religion hub and debate religion (in the side bar) are much better places to have an open discussion about your beliefs (IMO).  If you care about your girlfriend past religious views it really shouldn't matter. Most theists aren't the slobbering anti science, homophobic, YEC's that /r/atheism portrays them to be.  There are a few specific points in your post that I would like to adress though.  &gt;I believe in evolution, quantum theory, human psychology, and advanced other scientific theories.  This is the worst part of /r/atheism IMO. There *are* people out there who deny scientific theories because of religious views. This is *not* the stance of everyone though. Not all Christians are young earth creationists.  &gt;Not on a rickety set of fucked up morals and beliefs Christians have.  Again, /r/atheism showing through here. Most christians aren't the WBC. Most don't follow old testament laws. Many people are christians and have the same morals as you and me just gain them from a different area.  &gt;You can not prove that some higher power, deity, or higher state of being **does not** exists; therefore I will keep believing it.  Bolded by me. Is that what you meant or am I just confused?  &gt;In some studies about near death experiences (NDE) the people with that had some kind of NDE have seen some bright light, someone or something comforted them saying something along the lines of ""Now is not your time, go on."" or ""I do not need you yet, go home.""  Personally, I wouldn't use NDE's to justify my belief in an afterlife if I were you. **Near** death experience means that they didn't actually die. The brain is a very complex organ and when it is malfunctioning very strange things can happen.  Just a personal note from me that I don't believe it is a very valid argument.  TL;DR Shut out /r/atheism. Delete all of the positions of /r/atheism from your brain.

I'm currently brainstorming story ideas, possibly for a video game in the distant future.

It's a feature of being alive. There's no shame in not wanting to die, but it's not really something we can change. Yes, there are promises of immortality under certain definitions like transhumanism or religion but none of them have produced anything actionable yet.  Nothing is precious because it's permanent. We don't stop to admire a sunset because it will always be there and always look the same. Do we waste our lives worrying about losing it like a miser trying to hoard pennies or do we enjoy it? My advice: [have a donut.](http://www.stanleycolors.com/2013/12/life-donuts/)  If you find you can't resolve this on your own, [seek help.](https://seculartherapy.org) This anxiety is fairly common, and there's no shame in admitting you can't fix it on your own. Most therapists will make allowances for income and prorate their services or figure out some accommodation. Your mental health is important.","Check out anything by Sam Harris. The whole purpose of his ""mindfulness"" meditation is really to help people transition ""prayer"" into something real. Many features of mindfulness including work to wish positivity to people in your life is specifically meant to replace praying. Mindfulness is specifically targeted at fighting anxiety as you train your mind to be in the current moment for a period of time and let go things in the past and future (like death) to focus your mind.  &amp;#x200B;  Check out the ""mindfulness"" app by Sam Harris, it contains a hundred podcasts with scholars from the largest universities in the country (PHDs in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, etc...).

I've read some things that were written in very bad English but I think I got the gist of it, and it's essentially showing off your beauty to strangers. So is it gender specific and it only applies to women? There seems to be an acceptance that women do want to look nice but how much is too much?  See what confuses me is that some websites say tabarruj is specifically when you are trying to get the attention of men and being seductive. But see, all the clothes I own hug my waist and show my form, but I don't actually wear them with the intention of seducing men, it's just the clothes I have that I think look good on me, sometimes I don't even give it a second thought so it's not me trying to show off. Or is trying to look good by showing the good features of my body without the intent to attract men still considered tabarruj?   The things I read also mention a Hadith that says something along the lines of he who wears their best clothes that drag on the ground God won't even look at him on the last day. Where is this Hadith from? And when you want to look presentable how much is too much? Because it almost sounds that even wearing something nice is bad because you are essentially showing off.   It's worrying because the Hadith say that tabarruj invites the cure of Allah and that few women will enter heaven.","Tabarruj is forbiden for bith men and women.  As for the cut point between looking good and the start of Tabarruj, I believe it is when the outfit, accessories, makeup, etc. are anything besides what is permissible.  For example,  * men are not supposed to show their thighs so wearing shorts is not allowed, even in the hottest day of summer. * Men are not allowed to wear silk or gold. * Men are not allowed to cut their beards or eye brows. * Men are not allowed to wear jewelry or accessories associated with females (exept for rings). * Make-up is not allowed. * Fade haircuts  (I chose to talk about men cause as a man I know the rules for men but not 100% familiar with those of women)",Shorts are fine if they‚Äôre covering the knees right?,comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.7963741169

An old acquaintance was recently brought into membership and casually mentioned that he has a boyfriend whom he brought to church.  I reached out to the pastors, only to confirm our policy on members in public same sex relationships. They advised that it is subject to discipline if not repented from. I realize that he must have omitted this information from his membership interview to begin with. Now I feel convicted to speak with him one on one, as Jesus advises, before I try to notify our elders to take any disciplinary steps. I believe anything else but a private opportunity for them to hear some grace would be unjust.   Please pray for me. We were already planning on getting lunch, and I'm not necessarily a bad person to have this conversation with him. When I got saved I was in a relationship with another woman, although I was bi not lesbian, which is a lot easier. I know that addressing this issue is a natural part of my testimony and God is calling me to be forthright about it here. Nevertheless I'm really worried about disheartening or distracting a new believer. I do not want to break a bruised or reed or quench a smoldering wick.  Does anyone have any advice or encouragement for this difficult conversation?","Will be praying! The best counsel I can offer is to come alongside him and speak in terms of how you also had to wrestle with and battle this in your own life and how God granted you victory.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/Catholicism.jsonl,Catholicism.jsonl,ljv085,In response to the several posts about Protestant growth in South America. What I saw as a former Protestant Pastor in the Latino communities we served.,"My final year in Protestant Ministry was in 2017, so this is about as close to current ‚Äúintel‚Äù as I can offer.    My undergrad was from a Protestant Seminary in Biblical and Theological Studies. Vocationally my work was primarily in discipleship and outreach. In the protestant world discipleship is what we as Catholics would basically consider Catechesis.   The first, and primary, point is that Protestant mega-churches are NOT growing via proselytization or conversion of unbelievers. It is through cannibalizing small congregations and local parishes. The vast majority of new members were lifelong Christians from small Baptist/Methodist/Pentecostal churches or former Catholics. Many of these were 1st or 2nd generation Latinos almost all of whom were baptized Catholics.    This is important to understand to disabuse us of the notion that Protestants are significantly better evangelizers, or that they can make inroads in communities we are not. This is blatantly untrue. Instead, they excel at areas where Catholics seem to fail, community and engagement, and they use this inroad to quickly convert those who are mainly cultural Catholics. This is not meant to deride those Catholics who convert as uneducated, merely to relay how these conversions are accomplished.    In my church, which was a regional mega church, we had classes called ‚ÄúHow to save your Catholic Neighbor‚Äù. It involved three main steps.   1)	Ask questions about The Eucharist/Confession/Marian Dogma.  a.	Follow up with ‚ÄúWhere is that in the Bible?‚Äù b.	And then hit them with simple proof verses.  2)	Invite them to community events to demonstrate how loving and open our church was. 3)	Talk to them about Salvation by being ‚Äúborn again‚Äù.   These worked incredibly well, but the only people susceptible are Catholics that are too poorly catechized to rebut. As well as this worked on American Catholics, it worked ten fold on the immigrant population that we served.    The reason for this is simple, in Latin countries there is ‚ÄúCultural Catholicism‚Äù on a scale that Americans have simply never seen. When your Catholic Faith is assumed there is very little done to equip you to defend your beliefs.    The most frequent group of Catholic converts that we had were 1) Latino‚Äôs and 2) Catholic School graduates. Infer from that what you will, I believe there is a Catechetical crisis in the Church.    THE GOOD NEWS:   The Holy Spirit is shepherding the Church, and we see the evangelical community, frankly, rotting in much the same way the Anglicans did. Without authority they have deviated sharply from the truth, abandoned aspects of the faith which make them less marketable, and in turn have lost the ability to offer anything more than ‚ÄúThe Philosophy of Christianity‚Äù.    I am tremendously excited for the future of the Catholic Church, where we return to true catechesis and are able to serve those who are left empty by both secularism and protestant doctrine.","Interesting input. Thanks for sharing.  It seems like it all boils down to Sola Scriptura. The idea that Scripture is the final arbiter when it comes to doctrine and practice seems, at a first glance, the obvious position: ""Oh, it doesn't say it in the Bible, so it must not be something we should do."" -- it makes sense off the bat... but when you *really* think about it it doesn't at all. In fact as 2 Thessalonians 2:15, Philippians 4:9, 2 Timothy 2:2, 2 John 2:12, 3 John 1:13-14, and Acts 15:27 indicate: it is *contrary* to what the Scripture says.  Every non-Protestant Christian needs to be able to memorize, cite off the bat, and be able to explain the verses above and what Apostolic Tradition is. The faster we can educate all Catholic Christians about it, the faster Protestants will be reconciled into unity... Protestantism simply falls apart when you are able to properly see through the shallow ""Where is it in the Bible?"" arguments -- they can not cite a single Christian or Jew or holds their Biblical canon before the Protestant Reformation; so the fact they have a table of contents demonstrates Apostolic Tradition itself. Latino Catholics defending their faith really need to press Protestants on the issue of the canon. It's their acchiles heel. There's no coherent answer to it.","&gt;Follow up with ‚ÄúWhere is that in the Bible?‚Äù  I'll never understand how even poorly-formed Catholics can fall for that line of thinking.  Do these people really feel compelled to convert just because they don't immediately have an answer for those questions?  When you were a missionary, did you get the impression that a lot of these converts were already looking for a way out of the Catholic Church and just needed a final push?

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/ExploreReligion.jsonl,ExploreReligion.jsonl,3xk6aq,Reverse Engineering God: Applying logic to the question of why we live in an unjust world.,"The big problem I have with any monotheistic religion you could name, is that the combination of ‚ÄúBenevolent, Omnipotent, and Omniscient,‚Äù results in a logical paradox: Why would the world we live in be unjust if god is B.O.O.?  No one ever seems to argue that the world IS just, but there are 3 main arguments in the BOO God‚Äôs defence I often hear when I ask this question.  ---1) Free Will. Free will seems like a great response until you consider that not all injustice is caused by man. Is disease or natural disaster just? Killing only sinners and leaving innocents untouched? No? Then the world is unjust.  --- 2) It's All Part of God‚Äôs Plan. This argument annoys me the most, because it is another way of saying ‚ÄúThe Ends Justify the Means, if you are God.‚Äù  Well, if God is BOO he could have created a world free of disease and natural disasters that achieves exactly the same end goal as ours does. Having an imperfect world result in a perfect ending is not benevolent. BOO implies that he could achieve any goal without harming anyone.  --- 3) The World Is a Test for Afterlife. Even the very idea of being ‚Äújudged‚Äù in this life, for our eternal reward in the afterlife, seems wrong to me.  There‚Äôs a lot less free will than people like to admit. If you take 100 babies and give them to 100 abusive, terrible parents, a huge percent will turn into genuinely terrible people. If your parents are criminal sadists, you will probably grow up to be a criminal sadist. That‚Äôs human nature. We are largely the products of our environment, and yes, some people turn out to be saints despite the worse possible life, but you have to admit, the odds of going to heaven are stacked in your favor if you were born to kind and loving parents of reasonable affluence.  And while I might feel that every evil person deserves to go to hell, a BOO God would know every detail of every bad thing that happened to that person to make him into the evil person that he is. So how can a BOO God send someone to hell, knowing all that? Should only the people who inexplicably go evil despite having good parents and loving environment go to hell? Maybe they simply had some sort of neurological disease; A genetic error in their brain‚Äôs wiring. Should we excuse the insane from hell no matter what evil they do?  What is evil anyways? It certainly seems to vary by culture and religion, many of the things called good in some religions could be considered evil in others. It varies over time too, if owning slaves is evil, and I think it is, then did a huge percent of otherwise decent people go to hell because they lived in a time when it was accepted? Was owning a slave not evil before but somehow became evil today?  If God is of one particular religion, should you go to hell because you were unlucky enough to be born to the wrong one? Wouldn‚Äôt an BOO god clearly and precisely communicate a religion to the world so we know exactly which set of rules we need to follow? Why would an BOO god allow false religions at all? Seems unfair to be taking a pass/fail test when only a fraction of humanity is following any given set of rules. It‚Äôs not really your ‚Äúfree will‚Äù that determines what religion you believe in, 99.9% of the time, you will simply believe whatever your parents believed, and for those 0.1% that decide to change religions, it‚Äôs still a roll of the dice if you picked the ‚Äúright‚Äù one.  And if it doesn‚Äôt matter what religion you believe in so long as you believe you‚Äôve lived a good life, well that‚Äôs a huge can of worms, because by that definition you could do pretty much anything you want, if you‚Äôre crazy enough to believe in a crazy religion. Hitler himself might be sitting in heaven right now, if the only thing that matters is your own belief in the ‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù of your actions. We are not living in the ‚Äúideal‚Äù world for ‚Äútesting‚Äù humans.  I imagine such an ‚ÄúIdeal test world‚Äù would look a bit like a video game. The world would be cruel only because of man‚Äôs actions against man, and everyone would be born with an equal chance of being good or bad in their lives, based only on their free will. We would appear fully formed, possessing minds and bodies of equal value, and a set amount of starting wealth. Personality quirks and individuality would be encouraged, but only within set limits, no one would ever be born with defects that are not compensated by some other bonus in other areas.  And normally this is about the point the discussion ends, because you then have to say ‚ÄúThere is no God‚Äù, or he is not BOO. But, call me contrarian, but I actually DO believe there is a God, but our perception of him, as BOO is wrong. So if we take a leap of faith and, for the sake of argument agree that there is a God, let‚Äôs approach this from a different angle:  --- ‚ÄúWhy would God create the world as it is?‚Äù  First some basic assumptions:  --- 1) God is not Evil or Indifferent. This is a big assumption, but a logical one. If god were evil the world would be much worse than it is. I can imagine a world that actively hates us and a wicked sense of irony about it.  If God is indifferent, why create us at all? It is beyond belief to assume that God created the universe, with so many variables set just right, for life and evolution to produce intelligent life, by mistake or accident. It would have to be a very incompetent or lucky God to make us without intending to, which is pretty silly. If we were made by intent, then God is not Indifferent.  --- 2) God is not Omniscient or Omnipotent. This is really about the only way way you could have a Benevolent God at all. Quantum mechanics, specifically the ‚Äúobserver effect‚Äù seems to actually support this idea, since the behavior of particles changes when observed, it follows logically that God does not observe everything. In fact, the Uncertainty Principle seems to make it impossible to be Omniscient in the absolute sense.  Maybe God is the exception to these rules? But why would he write those rules in the first place if they don't apply to him? That would seem almost petty of God to specifically prevent anyone else from being Omniscient.  More likely, is that those rules exist because God is not Omniscient or chose not to be Omniscient. And of course, if God is not Omniscient, even by choice, then he is also not Omnipotent. By definition Omnipotence has no limitations, and not being Omniscient is a huge limitation.  What's really interesting is the idea that quantum mechanics is basically how you introduce randomness into a universe you've created, like a programer would introduce randomness into program he created, specifically so that you will always end up with unexpected results when you run the program or create your universe.  --- 3) There universe has a purpose, and there is something beyond death. This is the biggest assumption of them all. But also logical if you have a Benevolent God. It seems cruel to create intelligent life that has no purpose and will vanish when it dies. If I wrote an AI self-aware enough to feel pain and ponder it‚Äôs own mortality, I would have to be a monster to do so for no reason and then let it simply die. If we suffer, there must be a reason why. If that reason is to be worth it, there must be more to life than just what we can observe. This is by far the most optimistic ground rule, but hope is a powerful thing.  --- 4) The universe is just on a large enough scale. This assumption is probably the most difficult to prove. We have no way of knowing what lies beyond death, and any attempt to justify the unjust observable world by imagining an intangible element that balances it, is really just wishful thinking.  But. if we assume a Benevolent God, don‚Äôt we also assume a Just God? Is Benevolence not tied to a conceptual framework of justice? Can you be both Good and Unjust? I suppose you could be, given that any framework of ‚ÄúGood‚Äù and ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù we might conceive of is going to be different than the framework of an entity who started a universe. Who knows what goes on in the mind of God? If God has his own moral framework that is totally alien to our own, to the point that the deaths of millions to disease and natural disasters can be ‚ÄúGood‚Äù to such a God, then why create us with a moral framework so different than his own? Is such a god Benevolent, if our suffering seems ‚ÄúGood and Just‚Äù to him? I really can‚Äôt see how.  So let‚Äôs Reverse Engineer God from these 4 assumptions.  The easiest first step in my mind is Reincarnation. For many reasons, first, it eliminates many of the perceived injustices I mentioned above. If each life is simply one step in your journey, then you will have good lives and bad lives. Maybe if you live enough lives, you will average it out. Sometimes you will be lucky and other times, not. On average, on a large enough scale, everyone gets an equal chance at happiness.  But reincarnation by itself is not enough. Many injustices remain, but simply removing Omnipotence from the description of God actually helps a great deal. Think of it this way, yes our world is imperfect, but those imperfections are part of the evolutionary process. While it is shitty that innocents suffer, if this is the best God could do, if this imperfect world represents the best possible outcome for a Benevolent God trying his best to achieve a particular end, then maybe it‚Äôs not so bad. Certainly on the personal level, the victim of disease or natural disaster is treated unfairly, but on the scale of our species, it is precisely these problems that motivate us to improve.  Would an Omnipotent God do it this way? No, because it‚Äôs an imperfect solution, and Omnipotence is about being able to create impossibly perfect solutions, which is why I firmly believe God, if he exists, is not Omnipotent. An Imperfect but Benevolent God gets a lot more slack. With great power comes great responsibility, true, but with absolute infinite power comes infinite responsibility. If God is Omnipotent, then everything bad that happens is his fault. If God is not Omnipotent, then bad things happen because there was no better way.  Ok so we have an imperfect world, and an imperfect God who does not judge us but instead sends us back time and time again to live out our lives. Is this just?  No. Because if God is imperfect, he would have chosen to impose this world upon us without our consent. Yes it‚Äôs not a terrible world, and we should all be thankful for our lives, but none of us asked to exist, and if God does not know how things will turn out, then, it is immoral of him to create us into this imperfect world. Suppose I was a genetic engineer who wanted to ‚Äúsee what would happen‚Äù if i randomly introduced mutations into hundreds of babies. Would that be ethical? No, because I‚Äôve created suffering, sure some of those mutations might be beneficial, and some of those babies might grow up to be happy, but each time they did not, because of my own limitations, turn out well, I would be at fault. If God is playing dice with our lives, he is knowingly imposing suffering on us.  In my mind, the central flaw of reincarnation is its lack of justice. If Hitler gets to simply move on to his next life, then how is that fair? Religions that believe in reincarnation often talk of karma, but how is that enforced? Will God choose each of our fates based on lives we don‚Äôt remember? That also seems unjust. How are we to be held accountable for the actions of our past selves when we don‚Äôt even remember them.  --- This is Reincarnation 2.0, and I can‚Äôt claim credit for this idea on my own, but I did mesh it with the other parts of my theory:  What if instead of a large number of souls each living our lives over and over, there is only 1 soul. What if every sentient life is that one soul, living out trillions of lives?  The beauty of this as a framework is that it also provides justice. Any action you take to harm someone is harm you will personally experience in some life. Assuming you keep your memories of all your lives after death, and can feel regret for your mistakes, then there is justice. The very nature of infinite reincarnation means that we are our own punishment. Hitler gets to live with the knowledge of what it felt like to die at his orders, millions of times. He lived the life of every jew that died in the holocaust. Knowledge of his deeds, at the moment after his death, will be personal. He will know how it felt, and know how it felt to hate the person he was. That infinite soul will regret that life forever.  And every time we live an amazing life, we will remember it and appreciate it for what it accomplished. Those good deeds from that one life will make the lives of everyone that good person touched better, and we will be benefiting ourselves many many times over.   And that‚Äôs when I hit upon my next insight:  What if God is inflicting this suffering on himself?  I imagine a scenario like this:  In the beginning God created the universe because he wanted to experience life. All the good and the bad. He knew that there would be great suffering, and that in each life, he would not know that he was God. Every time he hurts someone, every time we hurt someone, we are hurting ourselves, because we are all the same soul that is God. He places himself in each of us, to learn from our lives, remember every moment, so in the end of time, when he has lived countless lives, he has learned what it means to be alive. Is the world injust?  Yes, but we chose that, because we wanted to make a universe capable of evolution.  Are we cruel to each other? Yes, but we are punished for it because we also live the life of every victim. Maybe in that space of time between each rebirth, we pause to think about our life, and relive every event in that life from the point of view of the people we've hurt and helped.  Is the world imperfect? Yes, but that very imperfection makes our lives fuller, more varied, and gives us a greater chance to truly excel, even if sometimes, we are born in lives that are truly awful, we also sometimes live lives that are truly magnificent. It is within us to make the best of our life, and we won‚Äôt be judged, but simply remembered, because it is our experiences in life that God created the universe for.  Really, the only question that matters is, was your life memorable in a good way? And did you make the lives of others better? Then your life was a good one.  By being all of us, one soul, a soul that lives countless times, and was the same soul that created this universe, we are part of a framework that is just, even if, only when considered on the very largest possible scale, the scale of God himself.  By being both God and the thing God created, we achieve moral balance. Our lives are God's willing self-sacrifice, because there was no other way God could experience the full range of what it means to be alive but to be a part of each of our lives, knowing full well that every life would know pain. We exist by informed consent, because we created ourselves.  By suffering through our suffering, God absolves himself of the moral debt of our suffering. It is instead the price we were willing to pay for all the joy and learning that life can bring. And it provides an answer to the ultimate question: Why were we created at all?  --- In conclusion and as a disclaimer:  I am not saying this is the one true religion and everyone should believe in it. This is just a mental exercise, and a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario I like to think about every once in awhile. But it‚Äôs not meant to be taken completely seriously. I just like to think, that instead of saying ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe do know, because this is what it says in this book,‚Äù we should dream up our own Gods. Think of ways we‚Äôd like to see the universe.

(Like it says that they were not ashamed before they ate the fruit, then later they hide from God because they‚Äôre ashamed.) Is sin itself anything that causes shame or fear for yourself or a neighbor (generally at least), and makes you feel that things your ashamed of can separate you from or make you hide from God/love?   Idk if I worded this well but I tried,,","I definitely think shame is something that separates us from God if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre saying. A saying I really love is ‚Äúshame is guilt persisting to personal detriment‚Äù Guilt leads us to conviction, and can be very healthy, but shame is our way of using that guilt to punish ourselves. Jesus literally died to take away the punishment for our sins and yet so often we refuse to forgive ourselves and dole out our own punishment - which it unjust and unjustness can totally separate us from God - or at least being able to feel God close. I don‚Äôt think God ever leaves us.   That‚Äôs why the culture of shame in modern churches really bothers me. It‚Äôs unjust as well as unnecessarily. If you listen to conviction and try to do better next time, you have nothing to be ashamed of.","Yea definitely!! That‚Äôs a really good quote. I also feel like a lot of things that mention darkness vs light can also have to do with hiding shame and fear vs being vulnerable and knowing you‚Äôre loved even if you feel ashamed for whatever reason?   I‚Äôd also like to add that, since this story is about the origin of sin, that the fact that the first thing that happens is shame and hiding is interesting to me. And the fact that God was angry about them being told they were naked and them being ashamed of it, and not angry about them being naked, is just really interesting to think about to me. Obviously I don‚Äôt mean this like ‚Äúwe should never feel bad about anything‚Äù I just mean like shame creating a lack of vulnerability and love yknow? I‚Äôm not the best at getting what I mean in my mind across in words so sorry again if this doesn‚Äôt make sense lol, but it‚Äôs just one of those things to think about that I feel like I frequently learn or realize something new from :)!",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.05198031213

Basically, I suggested that there's an actual need for a reddit community that gave support and advice to people who find that their minority status as atheists puts them in difficult social situations, but that those posts tend to get a mixed response, or simply lost in the mix, at /r/atheism.  Now that you're here, this thread is for sorting out any details that may need to be addressed concerning how this community should be run.  I'll start with two things.  1. In the sidebar you'll notice that I've put a link to /r/atheism, suggesting that questions about religious debate be taken there. I did so because I think the need that isn't being suitably addressed is mostly personal and social. If anyone has a problem with that, now's the time to bring it up.  2. Generally speaking, I'm all for laissez faire moderation, but with support group-oriented reddits, I think a heavier handed brand of moderation is called for. To that end, I think we should expect a certain standard of civility in here, and moderate out any comments or posts that don't adhere to that standard.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/TrueChristian.jsonl,TrueChristian.jsonl,f1agal,Teenagers...,"Hi, I'm looking for some guidance.   My teenage daughter recently told me that she doesn't believe in God or religion and doesn't think I should make her go to church. I asked her what she did believe in, and she said 'nothing'.     I basically told her that I disagreed and as long as she lived in my house or until she was an adult, she had to go to church. Perhaps this was an error. But I did it nicely, and reasonably I thought, also listing several non-religious benefits to attending church. She's never wanted to get involved or put herself out there with the other kids her age, and I thought if she would, she'd get more benefit out of it.     However this morning when it was time to get ready she got upset about it and we rehashed our positions, and I suggested she go talk to my husband/her dad. I guess I expected him to fully support my position, but he didn't. I suppose I shouldn't be that surprised. My husband is a non-believer (I came to Christ after we were married). He doesn't attend church, or believe in any of the things I believe. I guess I just thought he would support that I was trying to do what I thought was best for our child whether she liked it or not (as one does in all areas of their life).  Instead, he said that by forcing her I was going to push her away from it and make her resent religion and me. He cites that as his reason for not going to church/believing because his parents forced him to. We compromised with her going twice per month, but none of us are completely happy with that arrangement.   I feel like that is one argument satan uses. Yes, I was 'forced' to go to church and believe as a child, and yes, I had my period of rebellion from my parents/God, but I came back. I've only been saved a few years and we've only been attending church for about 2 years. I feel like she doesn't have a solid enough foundation to go back to when she's older. I feel like letting this go will be 'allowing' her to stray. But I do also see the logic of the argument that it will push her away if I force her.  I do believe ultimately if I decided to force her, that my husband would back me up, even if he didn't agree or like it. I also believe that she will resent me/church as a result.  So what do I do? What do I say? I thought the only one I had to worry about being lost was my husband, but now it's half my household. And who knows, with them as examples, if my youngest will follow the same path.  I feel so much sadness and desperation over this. I know it's likely the least of the battles I will have with her over her teenage years, but I also think it is the most important.     Does anyone have any advice? :(",I am not a teenager and I don‚Äôt really have any advice for you.   You‚Äôre in a really tough spot. I will be praying for you and for your husband and daughter to want to be involved.,"I‚Äôm no parent but I sort of have the notion that if someone is not born again then they are a false convert. That statement is heavy, but I also would not say that they shouldn‚Äôt go to church. It‚Äôs just important to recognize that it is a thing.  Some people aren‚Äôt real believers yet they go to church anyways because of the community and want their kids to have that and have a sense of networking, support system, etc.  For example, my mother in law wasn‚Äôt a real Christian when she started going to church and brought her kids along. Years later she ended up getting cancer and during that time she became born again. And now church has greater priority and meaning for her.  My wife, when we were dating, I started going to church with her as just another means to hang out with her. Eventually I was born again in my own back yard one night. And then I ended up leading her to Christ as well. She knew the language, had heard it her whole life, but it wasn‚Äôt until I showed her how serious it was that she understood who God was finally.  And if anyone else had tried what I said to her, it might not have worked because, well, she was head over heels for me.  I understand how tough it is because on one hand you don‚Äôt want to force religion down her throat, but on the same coin you want her to desire church herself. It‚Äôs unfortunate but this is very natural. My wife and I, and the pastor‚Äôs kids, are the only ones who stayed faithful out of our entire youth class of like 30 people.  My wife‚Äôs sister left too, she just didn‚Äôt believe and nobody could make her go, she was an adult now and had her own perceptions.  I don‚Äôt think it should be forced. That‚Äôs my opinion. She‚Äôs growing up and is finding out she has the freedom to believe what she wants and do what she wants. I also understand it‚Äôs your house and your rules.  I think all you can really do is let her go and pray. You don‚Äôt have to let this come between you guys. It‚Äôs very possible that she could find resentment later in life towards Christianity and the stereotype to parents forcing their children into it, especially when the parents do so in anger and frustration.  You should probably go talk to your pastor about it alone with your husband. That would probably help the most.",comment_2,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

Righteous Anger  Ephesians 4:26-27  Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity.  So clearly anger that is sin is one that is fast and quick tempered because of a lack of self-control, gentleness, patience, etc., does not seek to understand, is folly, and the sun goes down on it. It is also this type of anger that can lead to further sin.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/mormon.jsonl,mormon.jsonl,dy8j5x,The strange phenomenon of being struck down by the Spirit,"Throughout the Book of Mormon, we read of multiple accounts where an individual is struck down by the Spirit, usually in relation to thinking about all their sins or asking God to have mercy on them. The person often remains motionless and appears as though they are dead until at some point they awaken, filled with the Spirit and usually praising God.  Consider some of the following examples:  * When Ammon preaches to King Lamoni, the king falls down as if dead (Alma 18:41-42). He later rises and praises God (Alma 19:12). * The servants of King Lamoni cry unto God and eventually all fall down as if dead and the king and queen fall down with them (Alma 19:16-18). Later the queen and king arise, praising Jesus (Alma 19:29-30). * Alma the younger describes his experience of being in the same sort of state for three days until he awakens being filled with the joy of Jesus (Alma 36:10, 12, 18-20). * King Benjamin delivers his christian sermon and the listeners fall to the earth in fear before rising filled with joy and praising Jesus (Mosiah 4:1-3).  This is somewhat of an odd phenomenon considering that I have never had nor even heard about someone today having this sort of experience. I never experienced this with investigators on my mission and yet it‚Äôs so prevalent throughout the Book of Mormon.   Did God just stop granting these sorts of experiences to people? An even more important question is, was this sort of experience common in Joseph Smith‚Äôs day? Are these christian born-again experiences happening centuries before Jesus was born just another anachronism in the Book of Mormon that is best explained by looking at Joseph‚Äôs cultural milieu?  Richard McNemar writes the [following](https://books.google.com/books?id=HNVGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=‚Äú‚ÄúThey+all+seem+to+be+wrought+in+an+extraordinary+way;+lie+as+though+they+were+dead+for+some+time,+without+pulse+or+breath;+some+longer,+some+shorter+time.‚Äù&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0oJKaw_TlAhVSQq0KHbLxAacQ6wEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) in *The Kentucky Revival* (published in 1846 but here he‚Äôs quoting a letter written in 1801):  &gt; They all seem to be wrought in an extraordinary way; lie as though they were dead for some time, without pulse or breath; some longer, some shorter time. Some rise with joy and triumph; others crying for mercy. As soon as they get comfort, they cry to sinners, exhorting day and night to turn to the Lord (p. 20)  I‚Äôm sure other early 19th century examples of these sorts of experiences could be found. I think this sort of thing was probably common at the time, especially in Joseph‚Äôs area with all the camp meetings during the 2nd great awakening. The question is why these experiences end up in the Book of Mormon. Perhaps Book of Mormon people really did have christian born-again experiences centuries before Christ was born and they just happened to have the type of experiences that christians in the early 19th century were having. Or, perhaps more likely is that Joseph was inserting into the Book of Mormon experiences from his own cultural milieu.",Paging u/bwv549. I know you keep tabs on items from Joseph‚Äôs cultural milieu.

I went through something really traumatic a few days ago (I‚Äôm not comfortable going into details) and I feel really guilty about the fact that I didn‚Äôt turn to God right afterwards. What I feel guilty about is the traumatic thing happened, and I didn‚Äôt even want to think about God right afterwards. I just felt cold and dead inside, like I had no feeling at all. I had no desire to pray about it and I had no desire to turn to God. It was like I was dead inside and couldn‚Äôt feel anything.

I couldn‚Äôt even look at a Bible, I just didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with God for a few days after the traumatic event happened. It makes me feel like a weak, faithless Christian. Has anybody else dealt with something like this?","Yes, I have felt something like that.  After finding out the extent of my daughter's disabilities and the likelihood that she would die before reaching adulthood, I felt dead inside for a few months.  Right after her birth, I prayed and was strengthened by faith, then the doctors started coming out with more information... And more... And the situation kept getting worse.  My wife was hurt and angry and at the end of her rope, and I felt like my prayers had been mocked, that even that strength that I did have was taken.  It wasn't so much the quantity of the trouble as it was how cumulative it all was... Every time it seemed I had a handle, it got a little worse.  Eventually I realized my prayers were empty, and I wasn't really in touch with anything anymore.  That I was just waiting for the worst to happen, no longer even hoping for better.  At that time by coincidence I heard someone on the radio talking about a similar moment in their life, and the lesson of Job (the speaker was Jewish).  And they said something about needing to unload the anger and frustration with God to God... To yell at God, essentially.  The idea is something like that when these darkest moments come we hide our real feelings from God because of our religious upbringing, our desire to express only gratitude and appreciation... And if we don't have a lot of appreciation right now, the dialogue stops.  So while I was driving I kind of let loose on God.  I cried and yelled and got mad and said I hated Him for what He was doing to my daughter and my wife, that it wasn't fair.  I cursed Him and railed and let it all out.  And at that point, I was able to feel something again... I could feel His love around me and His sorrow at what was happening.  I've come to think that it wasn't that God went away from me, rather that I stepped away from Him.  Out of, essentially, politeness and piety.  I didn't want to condemn and criticize Him or His plan.  But that was what I was feeling, it was real, and it was all I *could* feel at that time... It was the natural reaction.  So in hiding what I was feeling, I blocked myself off from Him.  Once I could admit my anger, I was able again to feel his love and support.  My daughter is still here today, and every day I thank God for my time with her, however long or short it may be.  I came to be able to see the beauty in my world again through the pain, and have a relationship with Him.  But I haven't been able to regain the pink cloud of ""everything is beautiful and works out for the best"" naivete that I had before...  Not sure if that is growth or backsliding.  But it is me, now.","Sometimes, things can jar you pretty badly. You shouldn't quench the Spirit. However, you repented. So, you're fine.",comment_1,Acknowledges Personal Beliefs,,,,,,No,0.273904758

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/Buddhism.jsonl,Buddhism.jsonl,fr9uuy,Looking for advice to make meditation accessible,"Hello all!   I've hit an obstacle in my meditation practice and I'd appreciate some advice from this community, especially since I have no teacher yet and my group isn't meeting due to the quarantine.  For context: I'm disabled, I have a rare sleep disorder that few people know of and this alone makes it hard to find resources specifically about meditation. This illness makes me painfully sleepy 24/7. Sitting for more than 2 minutes without ""doing"" anything usually has me fall asleep. I can't drive, I can't even walk very far. Nothing helps.  I've been meditating for a few years now (mindfulness of breath + vipassana mostly) and I've come to a point where I cannot keep a daily practice where I'd sit for even just 20 minutes each day anymore. Walking meditation works well although I can't always do that because of mobility reasons, but sitting is very hard for me. I've tried every tip I could find to fight drowsiness while meditating but they're meant to fight off the ""usual"" drowsiness when in my case even actual drugs barely work. Lying down is impossible.  The only ""trick"" I've found so far is to use a mala and count my in- and out-breaths. It increases sensory input and thus keeps me awake, enabling me to meditate properly. I suppose this is a rather non-traditional way of using a mala but it works. I don't know for how long though.  I'm planning to attend the teachings of a Tibetan monk in my area as soon as the COVID19 situation allows it. However in the meantime  I thought you guys might have some tips, hence this post.  Does anyone have an experience of having to fight off 24/7 fatigue in order to practise daily? Do you have any tricks I could try?  Thanks in advance! With metta","The mala trick is a good one. Traditionally, part of the point of seated postures is that it encourages the body to relax. In your case, your body is about to nod off anyway, so you may need to simply come up with ways to engage the body a little more or keep the mind more active.  Can you stand for a while? Standing is actually a traditional posture mentioned in the sutras, but almost no one discusses it like sitting or walking meditation. I've seen people fall asleep on their feet before, but if you can do it safely it might be another way to keep yourself engaged on days when you can't walk. You can position your hands as you would for walking meditation (hand clasping fist is what I'm most familiar with), or try and hold the dhyana mudra as you might when seated. Just take a balanced stance and keep your back straight.  A simple tai chi/qi gong exercise might be another way to focus on the breath while keeping your body engaged enough that you aren't at risk for falling asleep. Another option might be to try some kind of more active meditation, like a visualization or metta practice where you're leading yourself through a series of steps, rather than just watching the breath until you drop off.  For any of these or for sitting, using shorter periods with a timer can reduce the chances that you are going to nod off, or give you a chance to re-set when it does happen. If you break it up into a few sets of 5-10 minutes, maybe changing postures in between, it's less likely your session will turn into an extended nap.  You can have some interesting experiences lying down to meditate and watching yourself fall asleep- some teachers encourage students to try and continue to practice when they are going to bed at night, and for some people it can make it easier to transition into lucid dreaming or dream yoga practices.","Thank you so, so much for taking the time to write this extensive reply - these suggestions are so helpful. I really appreciate it.  I will definitely get into Qi Gong, I never thought of replacing some sittings with a Qi Gong exercice but it makes a lot of sense. I've tried it before and I know that it works well in keeping me awake and focused.  I don't know that I can stand for 5 minutes or more, but if I combine standing meditation with a bit of walking, Qi Gong and/or a bit of sitting it should be no problem to try it. I haven't come across it very often, thank you for those quick instructions. Ultimately a routine made of small sets in different postures could be super helpful. As you say, it would allow me to refocus when I notice I've nodded off.  I've tried some visualization exercices in the last week and I've noticed that it does indeed help with maintaining alertness, so I'll definitely explore that more. As for watching myself falling asleep, I've been doing that for a while now and it's a very interesting experience, especially since I never really thought about it before - it can be odd but it's definitely worth it.

I've recently been kind of interested in paedobaptism, and I no longer recoil at the thought of it. In fact I'm open-minded towards it now. I've been taught that regeneration replaces circumcision, not baptism. Can anybody convince me of paedobaptism?","Sure, I'm down--- but there are about a million different ways to come at this conversation. I'll start here:  As a Presbyterian pastor, when I baptize an infant, I and adaptation use the Church of Scotland's liturgy, which is actually an adaptation on the French Reformed Liturgy. I say something like this:  [name], beloved child of God,  For you, God sent Jesus Christ into the world,  For you, Christ lived and showed your steadfast love  For you, Christ suffered the darkness of calvary,   and cried and the last it is accomplished  For you Christ triumphed over death and rose in newness of life,  For you Christ ascended to reign at God‚Äôs right hand.  All this Christ did for you, [Name], beloved child of God  Even though you may not yet know it,  And so now, through these waters, now and forevermore  May the words of scripture be fulfilled:  May you come to walk in love, because God has loved you first.  In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit we ask it, Amen.","As far as scripture goes, I find helpful connection between circumcision (in the OT) and infant baptism. Of course an 8 day old Hebrew child doesn't understand the law or the covenant, but his inclusion in that covenant is evidenced by an outward and communal sign. He belongs before he is capable of knowing it.  Baptism functions similarly. It is a theological claim that God chooses us before we can ever choose God. It helpfully identifies God as the primary agent in baptism as opposed to ""I decided to walk down the aisle and let Jesus into my heart.""  It's important to say that most Christian denominations that do practice paedobaptism have something called confirmation. This is usually a course of intense study during late middle school or junior high, wherein the person (having been baptized as a child) now takes on the faith of their own volition.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.2100589444

I was struck by how actually spiritual and moving the whole experience was--kneeling, drinking actual wine from the common chalice, the whole nine yards. I felt something a way I've never basically felt at a PC(USA) church. Wherever I've gone, it's always felt like people are a bit half-hearted about the Lord's Supper--the standing up and doling out of store-bought bread and tiny cups of grape juice always felt a bit silly and lame. Even if we're (usually) not memorialist, it feels like something we just do because Jesus said to do it, rather than anything truly sacramental. Not to mention not doing it every week implies that it's not really what we come to church for.  So I was wondering, how would you feel if your session moved communion in a more Episcopalian/Catholic direction? What objections would you have, if any? I would personally love it if my church moved toward taking the Lord's Supper a bit more seriously and having it be another center of the liturgy each Sunday, along with the sermon, even if it means a bit less time for other things.","I'm not sure about moving in a more Episcopal or Catholic direction wrt the form of communion, although I would approve of weekly communion. My old church did this, and it has come before session at my new church but it didn't fly for some reason.","We have tried to make communion services a little ""more"" lately and I think it is effective.

They're so welcoming to visitors and people that they invite to church...all because of stupid programs that will net them an Amazon and/or a restaurant gift card if they're the best. So Christlike, amirite!? /s  But if you're a visiting Christian who's just starting to get involved, and who's also going WAY out of his way to go to a specific church that's two hours round trip for me, and you go to introduce yourself to someone, and they just dismissively shake your hand and ignore you, then what does that say about that particular Christian? Yet, this individual is way more excited about being in their stupid clique of friends than they are going out of their way to be friendly to visitors...all because I'm not involved, am already ""saved"" (whatever that means anymore), and got baptized a long time ago.  The truth of the matter is, I've given up on what I call Churchianity a long time ago. All I'm looking for is a wife who's also looking to settle down, and who's open minded and is capable of doing more than just making babies and cooking food. I want to do things that don't necessarily revolve around church. Be it hitting up the gym together, playing games of the video, card, and board variety together, maybe working together on side hustles if we can make something work out, etc..

Who's to say that she won't start putting them on after engagement or marriage at some point?  I get that we all get old and ugly at some point, but I don't want to be desperate here. A lot of those who get married in their early 20's are only doing so for the sex because it's shunned so hard in Christianity, when the fact of the matter is that we're sexual beings, and doing things like just not talking about it isn't healthy, and has led to problems in my life to where I had gotten compulsions for things that I wouldn't have had my parents actually communicated to me about it in a healthier way than what they did.  tl;dr- I just want a normal life, something that I was told in my early years growing up that I couldn't have.

I originally began learning Vipassana Meditation around 7 months ago in an attempt to ward off undesirable sensual thoughts, and so that I can find some inner peace and mental clarity. My progress was rather steady, and around February I had advanced far enough till I was able to meditate for 30 minutes twice a day. I maintained this daily ritual until April or so, and during that period of time I felt immensely calm and peaceful, and I had begun to develop a deeper awareness of the world; as well as learning how to be mindful of my emotions as they manifest so that I can maintain my composure whenever negative and undesirable emotions began to plague me.  I was becoming more emotionally stable, but since May I've begun to lose my momentum and began to neglect my practices due to.. sheer laziness perhaps I will say. During these last two months or so, I've realized I've become emotionally impulsive again, quick to react to negative things, and overall I feel like my mindfulness has diminished greatly.. I don't feel at peace anymore like I used to and I feel more dominated by my mind than before. I want to ask if these changes have occurred specifically because of my practice began to waver so greatly? If so, I will definitely prioritize my meditation more than ever and resume practicing like I used to.  I feel like this increase in emotional sensitivity and inability to control my emotions lately is perhaps attributed to my lack of practice, and if that's the case I will embrace my practices again like no other.. Thank you for reading.!",Whatever I think doesn't mean much.  Why don't you try daily practice for two weeks and see if you notice a change?,"Sure your opinion matters. Sorry for not clarifying. I've been doing daily practice over the last 5 months or so.

I feel like I am not totally focused when I practice and I often don't sit still and I just start fidgeting and I just cut my sessions way too short, and I'm just not operating on a schedule like I used to.

This emphasis may be due to the fact that slaves constituted a great part - perhaps the majority - of the early Christian communities, even more, it is occasioned by the need to check the tendency to rebellion which the Christian gospel of freedom was bound to quicken in the mind of the slaves.  Here again, the fading of the eschatological expectations weakened the force of the appeal to endure a situation which was in any case fleeting; some other ground of patience had to be found when men could no longer be confident that the time was short.‚Äù (Beare, 1953, *TIB* vol. XI p. 227)   &nbsp;    >This passage [3:18-4:1] is unique among the epistles of Paul, though the same literary form is employed in several of the deutero-Pualine epistles (Eph. [Ephesians] 5:21-6:9, I Pet. 2:13-3:7; and less directly Tit. [Titus] 2:1-10; I Tim. [Timothy] 2:8-12 and 6:1-2) and in the writings of the Apostolic Fathers.  The form itself is a creation of Hellenistic oral philosophy, devised as a medium of systematic instruction in the duties for life in specific relationships.  ‚ÄòThere were philosophers who held that the function of philosophy was not to reveal the mysteries of the universe, but to advise mankind as to their conduct in the relations of domestic life.  Paul himself may have felt no little sympathy with this point of view‚Äô (Knox, *St. Paul and Church of the Gentiles*, p. 177) Knox cites Seneca (*Epistles* 15. 2 [94]. 1) who tells us that ‚Äòsome have allowed only that part of philosophy which ... tells the husband how to behave toward his wife, the father how to bring up his children, the master how to govern his slaves.‚Äô  ...   &nbsp;    >This awakening of concern for mutual relationships within the Christian household has a significance which does not appear on the surface.  It is in part a reflection of the decline in the emphasis on eschatology which we have noticed elsewhere in the epistle (see on 3:3-4); in part, also, of the more settled conditions of church life at the end of a generation of evangelism.  As the thought of the apostle ceases to be dominated by the expectation of the imminent end of history and of human society as it has been known, the settled life of the Christian family gains in importance for religion; the fundamental social institutions are no longer viewed as belonging to the conditions of an era which is swiftly to pass away, but as the enduring sphere of Christian living.  The earlier attitude of Paul, as reflected in this discussion of marriage in I Cor. [Corinthians] 7, offers a striking contrast to the passage with which we are now dealing.   &nbsp;    >In this connection we are bound to recall the subordination of family loyalty to the allegiance of the individual to Christ and to God which is forcibly expressed in the teaching of Jesus.  He rejects the family tie as supreme or decisive for himself (Mark 3:31-35, with its final ‚ÄòWhoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother‚Äô); and he demands that his followers also shall subordinate it to loyalty to himself: ‚ÄòIf any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple‚Äô (Luke 14:26).  It is clear that the coming of the gospel frequently brought strife into the household, as some believed and other rejected the message; and the believer was frequently obliged to make the harrowing decision between obedience to Christ and loyalty to his family.  All too often a man‚Äôs enemies were those of his own household, as brother delivered up brother to death, and the father his child, and children rose against their parents and had them put to death (Matt. [Matthew] 10:21, 34-39).   &nbsp;    >The introduction into Christian literature of the table of household duties reflects a time when these family divisions were no longer so general, and when the Christian community tended more to consist of entire households, with parents, children, and slaves...   &nbsp;      >We cannot fail to be struck by the meagerness of the instruction given to the different family groups ... It cannot be claimed that any great advance is made toward the formulation of a Christian ideal of family life here.  It is impossible to draw any sweeping contrast with the family ethic of the contemporary paganism ...‚Äù (Beare, 1953, *TIB* vol.

We get excited when skydiving because our bodies release neurotransmitters which cause us to experience things (in the above example, mostly (nor)adrenaline). Yet we take this to be real.   When one has a spiritual experience then, likewise, the body releases neurotransmitters (I'm looking at you, 5-ht* agonists) which cause us to experience what looks, feels and tastes like god. Yet so many take this to be fake.  Why the discrepency? Why believe that the experience created by one set of neurotransmitter configurations is any more real than another? Why is it that when I see a table I *know* it exists yet when one sees god they think that it does not?","Well first off you don't know that table is there. Like you said you just have the perception of the table. Many people are plagued with hallucinations where they are convinced that what they are seeing/hearing/tasting/feeling is real. I would group god in with this same type of effect, what people are experiencing is what they think is god but it may just be a normal brain function or it could be some sort of hallucination. Back to your table example, although it sounds funny there is many experiments we can do the verify that table exists. Like if I asked you how do you know that table exists, if you replied ""because I can perceive it"" I would say that is bullshit, that is a silly reason to know it exists. This all sounds silly because no on debates the existence of tables I am just following your example but you see the same cannot be done for God. There is no experiment that can be done to verify the perception of god thus it is not a valid conclusion to reach. It of course remains possible that you are perceiving god but since it cannot be shown experimentally it cannot be falsified.","Ah, but the same can be said for god. Allow me to demonstrate:  We percieve physical things indirectly, through our senses which in turn cause chemical and physical reactions. Therefore, the way any particular thing is *percieved* is an emergent property of the physical system. It also means that we have never seen a table, just the physical processes in the body which are affected by external stimuli (the table) which in turn affect our consciousness.  Since the primary mode of experience is not the world but these physical processes, it stands to reason that god does indeed exist as a chemical and physical reaction. It's as real as any other experience but the first step in the chain reaction is not outside of the body (as with the table) but is entirely inside of it. In other words, the physical location of god is in our heads. Based on this, how is god possibly not real? The reactions are physical, so they are real. The experience is equivalent to all other experiences, so it is real.  I bet that if you took a sample of a person's neurochemistry and electromagnetic brain activity during a spiritual experience, it would be distinct to the configuration present under normal circumstances. This is a physical change, it is objectively real.  Or to put it yet another way, god is as real as the neurochemicals in your head.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.7298245805

As stated in the title, I am currently anxious of what the future has to offer me. In shaa Allah, I will be sitting for three exams for three different job positions. Two of the positions have caught my interest as the positions are totally related to my degree qualification.   Ever since I found out that I'll be sitting for the exams (yesterday and last Monday), I have been praying to Allah, to make the process easy for me, starting from revision til the examination days. I have been praying Tahajjud and Salatul Hajat. I have seen videos that say prayers made during Tahajjud will be answered. However, I am afraid that if I get one of the jobs, it would be bad for me. like what if it is bad for my well-being, my religion, my family and my mental health? I have been asking Allah to give a job that is good for me, my family and so on but I don't know, I am really afraid. I don't mean to doubt Him though.   if you ask me why I am having such fear is because I have a bad work experience where I was taken advantage of, mistreated and worse, I had a nervous breakdown for three weeks where I cried almost everyday but Alhamdulillah, I wasn't suicidal. that incident made me question if I deserved such treatment and am I not good enough :(  I would be happy if I could get a piece of advice or two or anything that can help me get rid of my current anxiety. Please pray for me, I really need a job because I am tired of living in financial instability and I want to be able to help my family especially my mom. I haven't been able to pay her back because I do not have a stable income.   Thank you for your time, may Allah bless all of you.

How many income we will make this week, this month, this year etc. Everything is written. Never forget to say Alhamdulillah. All what we receive, or don‚Äôt receive, is from Allah swt.   Next to that, you have to believe in yourself, your skills, your determination. A new job is always scary, but not all employers are like the one where you were mistreated.

Lately I've given up on praying and even just talking to God. I feel too ashamed of my sins and failures and don't see a point to get back on track if I feel I'll fail God again. I also don't feel forgiven or know if it's me that hasn't forgiven myself. I don't feel worthy or like God even hears me.   After a breakup four months ago I became extremely dedicated to prayer and God. I think I burnt myself out by going too intensely. And I also suspect I was only so dedicated due to my own selfish motives and once I got over them I lost a bit of interest. Then a new distraction came into my life but it was short and I realize that I can't keep placing my happiness in these sorts of distractions.   Please please pray for me to be satisfied with the many gifts I already have in my life and to stop looking for happiness outside of them. Please pray for my attitude to turn around as I'm left with a feeling of emptiness and wondering what the point or direction of my life is. I'm unsatisfied with my love life, unsatisfied with my job, unsatisfied with certain friendships and mostly unsatisfied with myself. These are all things I would like to express to God though I'm sure he knows. But I don't feel he would hear me due to my failures or my lack of dedication to Him lately. Please pray for me I just want happiness again, I want some direction and purpose. I love the wonderful things in my life but I feel an emptiness due to having placed so much value in things that can't bring me the kind of happiness that will fill the void I feel, such as a relationship. Don't get me wrong I'd love to find the man who will love me and be with me but I can't keep dwelling and wondering when he will come. I don't know how else to really express how I feel.

FPC-Pomona has a small congregation, but its members are very involved in many different ways for the life of its community; I have seen a church find the opportunity for new and wonderful life with a dwindling congregation which has given me hope for the life of this denomination which may be dwindling in a number of ways.

For this purpose  the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil. 3:9 Everyone who has been fathered  by God does not practice sin,  because  God‚Äôs seed  resides in him, and thus he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God. 3:10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: Everyone who does not practice righteousness ‚Äì the one who does not love his fellow Christian  ‚Äì is not of God.  Romans 7:21-28 &gt;7:21 So, I find the law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me. 7:22 For I delight in the law of God in my inner being. 7:23 But I see a different law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members. 7:24 Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 7:25 Thanks be  to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then,  I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.  Note: I don't necessarily mean sinless since birth, but is it possible to stop sinning at some point in your life?  As I suspect the answer to this question will be no... if you cannot abstain from sin, how can it be claimed that we have free will?  If sinning is necessary for free will, what sense does it make to say that someone has will? If you had free will, you should be able to stop sinning. If something else (your nature) is forcing you to sin, that hardly constitutes having a ""free will.""","I think we would need a clear definition of ""free will"" in order to make sure we are both using the word in the same way. It sound like you are talking about [libertarian free will](http://www.theopedia.com/Libertarian_free_will). I would argue that we do not possess this kind of autonomy, and I don't know of any scripture that does. I would argue for [compatibilist free will.](http://www.theopedia.com/Compatibilism) So, with compatibilism in mind, I can use my will to do whatever I want. However, my will is tainted with sin and what I want to do is affected by that. I do what I want, and what I want to do is sin.  &gt; If sinning is necessary for free will,  Sinning is not necessary for free will; it is possible with free will. Jesus has free will. He did what he wanted to do, and what he wanted to do was please God. Angels also have free will; most use that freedom to serve God.  &gt; The bible seems to conflict here: John 3:6-10, Romans 7:21-28  These passages are written by two different people who had different writing styles. When John says "" everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him."" He isn't saying if you commit even a single sin you are no longer a Christian. John clarifies himself later in the passage with ""The one who **practices** righteousness is righteous, just as Jesus is righteous. The one who **practices** sin is of the devil,"" and with John 3:4 ""Everyone who makes a **practice of sinning** also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness."" The one who practices righteousness is the person who actively seeks it and put effort into repenting sin. The one who make a practice sin is the person who sins intentionally, repeatedly, and without repentance. There is a difference between falling into sin and diving into sin; this is the difference between the two verses when they talk about sin  In summation, I don't believe we have free will in the sense that you are describing, but I don't think that conflicts with anything in the Bible either.",No.    I don't even have to get into free will.  The Bible considers any sexual thought about anyone other than your spouse to be adultery.  So any attempt at a sinless life would get thwarted within a few minutes of going outside.

I‚Äôve brought up a few times that I identify as an atheist (I said agnostic for a lot of years which she was okay with) but she always glazes over it or ignores me completely.    I‚Äôm spending the weekend out in the country at their house doing homework and laundry because my building had a fire in the laundry room, and I *need* clean laundry. I was talking about the neighbors across the hall that smoke so much that my apartment smells like a lounge so I burn incense to cover the smell, and how they complained about my burning incense. I said something to the effect of ‚Äúif I were a Buddhist or part of a religion that uses incense in their practices I could claim it as a religious right. As an atheist I don‚Äôt get religious exemptions from the rules so I might as well claim some if I can.‚Äù I figured this would go unnoticed as it usually does and barely contribute to the conversation, it was intended to be more of a joke really. She paused for a moment, and got that ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù look on her face that used to send chills down my spine when I was a kid.   ‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt believe in god?‚Äù   Well damn, here I am. This is everything I‚Äôve prepared for. All that research in my free time, reading all those books, taking that painstaking journey through challenging my upbringing and questioning my faith, all the emotion I‚Äôve poured thus far into developing a solid self-affirmation of who I am. Taking anthropology electives this last year has made me really confident in my resolution. Ten years ago I would have balked at the question, caved and ultimately said something like ‚Äúyes, well mostly, well I‚Äôm not sure, but for the most part, but kind of in a different way‚Ä¶.‚Äù But for the first time I put on my big girl panties. The thought that I would be disowned loomed overhead. I remembered something that a guidance counselor said to me once ‚Äúif someone wants nothing to do with you because of something you do or don‚Äôt believe on a deeply personal level that only affects *you*, you didn‚Äôt want them in your life anyway.‚Äù But this is my mother. She will effectively cut me off from my entire family if she feels so inclined, and if they don‚Äôt cave then she‚Äôll revert to her suicidal tendencies to make me feel guilty. I took a deep breath and without hesitation felt the words fall from my mouth as naturally as breathing.   ‚ÄúNo. No I don‚Äôt.‚Äù   Her body tensed and her face tightened. Her lip began to quiver like it does when she‚Äôs trying with all her might to refrain from showing complete disgust. The same face she would give when we talked back, or got a bad grade on our report card. The face that looked down when I broke my brother‚Äôs arm wrestling (it was by accident he‚Äôs three times my size), or when I tore my leg open climbing a tree she told me not to climb. Only this time there was a layer deeper underneath, that deeper layer was steeped in hate and loathing. It was the face that I saw at church book burnings when she piled on Harry Potter and Origin of The Species only this time there was no satisfaction.   ‚ÄúReally.‚Äù   That was all she managed to say. It was less of a question and more of a statement or an accusation. I did my best to keep my cool. We debated, actually a really healthy debate, for about an hour. I explained my point of view; I‚Äôm good for the sake of being good, I accept responsibility for my actions in this life and acknowledge that I am the only one who can be held responsible for my actions, and that I hope when I leave this earth regardless of where I go there will be no bad memories of me. We talked back and forth for a while; I did not try to defend myself but only to explain. I did not try to dispute any of her points regardless of how much I disagreed; I only said that I understand completely why people feel that way but that it was not something that fit into my life. She started getting really passionate about how evolution is only a theory. Her voice rose and she put aside her knitting to get her hands into the conversation  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt tell me, no one can tell me, that you can take a bunch of random somethings and put them in a box, shake it up, and get a wrench. I didn‚Äôt come from monkeys, my mother was not a monkey, and if we all came from monkeys why are there still monkeys? They‚Äôve proven all of Darwin‚Äôs *ideas* to be just that. It‚Äôs a theory! You can‚Äôt prove a theory!‚Äù  Man was it hard to keep my mouth shut. Eventually I did speak up  ‚ÄúSo is gravity.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not it can be proven.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo, on a molecular or atomic level the ‚Äòlaws‚Äô of gravity start ceasing to apply. We can‚Äôt even fully explain what gravity is, or why gravity is, we just have an abstract idea of the effects of what we call gravity.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell the molecular and atomic level don‚Äôt mean shit. I only care about the stuff that affects human sized things, and evolution is just a theory based on an idea which makes it a lie.‚Äù   I wanted to rage. I wanted to scream and go off on all the rants I‚Äôve seen around reddit, and in books, and in lectures, and in journals, and papers, and peer reviewed documentation. But then in a beautiful and serene moment I remembered something that she herself used to say when I was a kid. ‚ÄúA man convinced against his will is of the same conviction still.‚Äù And I kept my mouth shut. Later she even said  ‚ÄúI believe in mutation, we can see mutations happening today. But that is *not* evolution.‚Äù   I didn‚Äôt even argue. I just let her have her way. For a while I almost felt jealous, I wish I could explain my life only using one book. I wish so many people in the world believed the same thing that I did. I wish sometimes it was that easy.  Sometimes I wish that I could pray and feel like that was the solution, I wish I had someone to talk to night and day and feel like they were unconditionally aware and loving and empathetic to my feelings.   Then I felt sad. I almost mourned for my mother that she would never experience the exciting and exhilarating experience of learning something new about the world around you. That new and uncomfortable feeling when you begin to challenge what you believe to attain personal inner peace and understanding would never be fun for her, it would only be threatening. I wish she could feel the wonder and excitement I felt in my first anthropology lecture or the ground beginning to shift under my feet when I read ‚ÄúThe God Delusion‚Äù for the first time. The first time that I felt like if I didn‚Äôt believe in god that didn‚Äôt mean that I would be alone, desolate, forsaken, or doomed. That would never be a level of enlightenment my mother would get to experience because she was blinded by years and years of indoctrination and hate.  For the first time today though I did get to feel something new; the feeling that I am completely alone in my life right now and I am okay with that. I can do this without god, without church, and without the bible. I can do this with the lessons I‚Äôve learned, and the knowledge I have.   I‚Äôm not asking for you to contribute, I‚Äôm not asking for advice, and I‚Äôm not asking for sympathy. I just wanted to put my thoughts somewhere so that when I drift off into the eternal naught maybe someone can benefit from my thoughts in some way.   edit: clarity, grammar.","I totally get where you're coming from. My mom is resolutely anti-evolution, and she likes it that way. She's not even willing to discuss the science, she just says she doesn't know enough and she's not interested in learning. She believes that faith is enough and she has no need to question it. My sister is the same way (perhaps worse because her husband is a pastor).   I have a really hard time explaining to them that I am so much more amazed by the universe now than I ever was before. I know so much more and have such a hunger to keep learning about the world of scientific knowledge. My favorite part of Christmas is watching my sister's kids open the science-related gifts I get them every year because I'm so excited to spread the joy that is science. It seems totally lost in my mom though. I feel like she actually gets mad when I buy the grandkids educational gifts because she thinks I'm trying to indoctrinate them. I just want to share how cool knowledge is.   Honestly I've given up on it with her. I accept that she's comfortable and I can't in good conscience tear the wool off her eyes.","This was powerful to read - especially those last few paragraphs.  I get it, sometimes I wish I had what my parents had; the complete assurance that someone is always listening to them and that all their dreams will come true eventually, on earth or in heaven.  But then I remember that they're living in a bubble and will never know that feeling of discovering or curiosity about the world. It is so painful to see them devote their lives to something nonexistent in the hopes of being rewarded with eternal life. It's ridiculous and so sad. They are being jipped out of the one life, the only time they have and ever will have to exist. I can only go on learning and exploring, hoping that they'll join me eventually!  So anyway, long story short- I know what you're feeling and appreciate you posting!:)",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.5250729699

Butt Jr","**Who Can You Trust?: Overcoming Betrayal and Fear**   by Howard E. Butt Jr.  [Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Who-Can-You-Trust-Overcoming/dp/1578568013)  We'll be discussing this book chapter-by-chapter, so please feel free to join in and add your own thoughts.  Each day we'll be adding a new comment thread to discuss each individual chapter and share what each chapter speaks to us. Please be sure to keep your comments to the correct chapter.       ---  **About the book**  &gt;Trust is the basis for every relationship. So what happens when that foundation cracks?   &gt; * A cheating spouse destroys the feelings of confidence and fidelity in a marriage. &gt; * A friend's betrayal causes mistrust to spread to your other close relationships. &gt; * An undermining co-worker creates a suspicious, tense, disjointed workplace. &gt; * Organizational board members work in secret to form coalitions to assume control.  &gt; Trust plays a key role in every arena of our lives, because trust is the linchpin for all our relationships‚Äìfamily, school, church, work, and community. And how we sort out all the issues of trust and mistrust determines the direction our lives will take‚Äìand our ultimate happiness and fulfillment. How can we build deeper, stronger trust in our relationships? How can we cope when that trust has been wounded or destroyed? How can we live a life of trust without being na√Øve about betrayal?  &gt;In Who Can You Trust? one of America's most beloved leaders, Howard E. Butt, Jr., candidly shares his own real-life experience and expertise to help you answer these questions in a biblical and practical way. He helps you recognize and resolve past trust issues that have shattered your faith and your spirit. And he shows you how to let your faith help you build stronger trust in the future for all your most important relationships.",**Chapter 1 - Looking Over Our Shoulder**   *The only way to make a man trustworthy is to trust him; and the surest way to make him untrustworthy is to distrust him and show your distrust* - Henry Lewis Stimson,"I can't help but make the connection between the trust being described and Fear. Is our post 9-11/Enron world a less trusting one? Perhaps, but did we ever truly trust large corporations to be moral? I would figure the 80s put paid to that for modern generations.   I'd say then, the issue is not just trust, but also fear. It is our lack of trust that causes us to live more fearfully. we're just as certain a trustworthy person will succeed as we are an untrustworthy person will fail, so isn't it our reaction to the certainty of both scenarios that is at fault here?  Why should it be that one certainty produces optimism and hope, yet another causes us to despair, fear and feel doomed? In a biblical sense, why do we feel confident God's plan will prevail over the good people do, yet is not soverign enough to cope with the certain disappointment others produce?  Isn't my own fearfulness as a result of distrust, more about my lack of trust in God and His plan, than the person I'm distrustful of?  I thought the quote from Joseph A Grudfest is worth mulling over, the line about: &gt;Societies which have a low degree of trust are backward societies.  It certainly seems reinforced by the commentary about locks on our doors and cars and taking it to one conclusion, the big brother scenario, I think it is clear that's a backwards step. One of the things that broke my heart was hearing that a neighbour in sub division, had lived here 5-6 years and never met a neighbour. I got told that about a year and I still haven't followed up with that person or reached out beyond my immediate neighbours. We all want that inclusive open community, we miss what we see as golden years of community from generations past, but I know I'm just as held back by fear of inviting strangers into my home as everyone else. ""What if they see we have nice stuff and want to rob us?"" Depressing isn't it?  The line ""Pure distrust - distilled over time - shrivels us, our live turn in on ourselves, our existence becomes unbearable"", really hits home for me. I've struggled with depression in the past and lack of trust left me a hermit. Even close friends I'd know for years, I'd question their motives when they'd invite me out. Why, exactly, do they want me at that party, to see me make an ass of myself? to point and laugh? Probably just pity, right? I could never trust their friendship was on the level. Who was I to have such awesome friends? I should stay home and hide. And I did, for many years.  In closing he talks about how we want to trust, how we don't want to be cynical. I can't say I follow that, I think we're more ready in this world to distrust. It is much harder to convince people of a noble and pure truth, than it is that someone screwed up. We're much faster to believe the worst of people than the best and perhaps that's partly down to pride (we don't want to see others succeed where we fail) more than distrust reigning supreme, but I'd say a trusting nature, doesn't seem to be the prevailing attitude I get from friends and family.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.2833566261

The users of /r/bahai are a very thoughtful group of people, and I would love to read your different takes on the same readings.

I propose that we choose one of the more weighty documents, and assign a reasonable amount of reading for that week.  The ""assignment"" would be included in the title of the thread, and remain sticky for a week.  Everyone discusses the reading in the comments, and then after a week, it loses its sticky status, and a new sticky thread is created for the next assignment.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/Catholicism.jsonl,Catholicism.jsonl,maogj7,A question about Judas,"Hello all, i hope you're doing well on this fine day.  To start with, i have been a catholic just recently (i started a couple years ago). So i have a question.   I have only a simple understanding of the the gospel so i am trying to learn more. Particularly on Judas' betrayal.   My understanding is that Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. He then realized his extreme betrayal and killed himself. My circle of church consider him as the epitome of evil and was quite reluctant to talk about him.   My question is, isn't his extreme feelings of guilt something he felt heavier than the forgivess of the lord himself? To the point he decided to kill himself?  I mean, look at some people now, willing to commit crimes/corruption to the detriments of others yet are able to kneel down during confessions and ask for forgivess but still commit the same crime after?   Judas had the conviction that he is wrong, to the point of killing himself, yet he is seen worse than these corrupt people? I just don't understand it.","Remember, Judas handed Jesus over for 30 pieces of silver. He knew he was guilty of the sin but despaired and didn't return to Jesus to ask for forgiveness. Peter on the other hand denied Christ 3x, but he came back and did ask fro forgiveness. In fact, Christ asked him 3xif he loves him to which he answered yes.","Matthew and Luke disagree on the circumstances of Judas' death.  If Matthew is right, then Judas may have been seized by some sort of sorrow, but his sin was despair.  That is, assuming that he could not be redeemed, and refusing to ask Jesus or his fellow disciples for forgiveness.  Taking the non-confrontational way out via suicide instead of true repentance.  If Luke is right, Judas just didn't feel sorrow at all, and planned to get on with his life and ignore the Christians.  Then he had an accident (or possibly committed suicide) at a later time.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.7999136521

Might As Well Throw This Out There.,"I was raised Baptist, but have since decided that I'm nondenominational.  I've personally thought it weird that an all-loving God would punish LGBT people. And even further than that, I've found double/predestination to be a concept that goes against God's mission for us.  Yet I'm having difficulty with the ""universalist"" view of Christianity.  I do find it odd that a revered, loving God just punishes people, unbelievers and what-have-you, forever. That doesn't sound much like love, I guess.  I'm unsure of whether or not Hell is real, or even what it is, but I know I don't wanna go there.  Being raised Baptist, I've always been told that salvation is a choice. I've likened an analogy to take-out at a restaurant. But universalism preaches that everyone will eventually be saved, and that the punishment for our sins is more or less temporary/purifying (which honestly sounds more loving than the view I've been taught).  Yet it's said that God loves everyone, and is going to save everyone (""every knee will bow, every tongue confess"" and all that). And I've also heard that universalism was the original belief until the third century of Christianity; and that ""eternal torment"" is a modern idea, potentially used to keep people in line.  So I'm not sure what to believe in regards to universalism. Maybe I'm just a ""hopeful universalist"", even though I dislike being defined by labels.  Any remarks?","My eschatological vision is of a ""Love Divine all loves excelling"". I don't know how that would work in the details, but I'm hoping God can figure it out.

I have two questions I'm sure since you are all interested in apologetic some of you have been following David wood. My question is I know that he turned his channel over to someone else but I also heard that he would continue his ministry off YouTube so that he would not be censored. My question about him is where can I find his content off youtube?  My second question is a little more traditional in apologetics. My question is when I hear people talk about the cosmological arguments for God it seems like the argument is very solid except for one part that I have not heard answers for. I always hear atheists say that we have knowledge of what the universe was about a second after the big bang but we do not know what was before it. Some like Frank Turek have said that Einstein's theory of relativity shows that time space and matter all came into existence at the same time but the atheist would argue that those things are already there they just exploded out. So what would you say to someone who is saying this?  And maybe a different way to reframe it or a similar question to ask is how do we know that there was nothing before the Big Bang and or what leads us to the conclusion that there was nothing rather than something?,"First, David Wood's new web site is [https://acts17.com](https://acts17.com) . David's last video on YouTube (prior to the ""takedown video"" was [https://youtu.be/Te73Fj3ZZiU](https://youtu.be/Te73Fj3ZZiU)     Second, in response to the atheist who says time, space, and matter ""were already there, they just exploded out"" of the singularity, you could say that they were not present in any \*meaningful\* sense. In the cosmic explosion, the three dimensions that we move in right now came into being. Time is only meaningful if motion of an object in space is possible. If I am summarizing the theory correctly, there was no motion or ""3-space"" prior to the big bang, and all the mass that is present and measurable in the universe today originally emerged from something smaller than a proton.  Put it in geometric terms, if you like. Suppose a square or a trapezoid (a 4-sided figure on a 2-dimensional plane) emerges from a geometric point in space, the point having no dimensional properties itself. It is really sensible to say that these objects were ""inside"" or existing within the point all along?  And if a sphere or a pyramid (3-dimensional objects) emerge from the same point of zero dimensionality, is it meaningful or coherent to assert that these objects were eternally existing within the point?  I don't think so. I think our atheist friends should concede that the emergence of an object of two, three, or more dimensions out of an object of zero dimensions is tantamount to creation from nothing, and it is less reasonable to argue that the objects were always there.","There is more than one form of Cosmological argument. There is WLC's somewhat well known ""Kalam"" version, but have been many other formulations and most do not involve the Big Bang of physics at all. Rather they involve the ontological nature of things that have a metaphysically contingent or derivative existence vs things that do not.  I do not find the Kalam the most compelling as it is contingent on current theories of Cosmology and most are not.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.9658934866

I have noticed some trends lately in comments on this subreddit. I realize this place is not the most active these days, so I figured this might spark some activity and trajectories while also clearing up some growing concerns in recent discussions. I propose we come up with a list of topics and some specific times to routinely get together and have some helpful round-table discussions on them. Ideas could come from things people are generally confused on, would like further information about, or individuals willing to share their knowledge on a particular topic (a modified AMA style). These discussions would not welcome vitriolic or parodic comments. The discussions would begin assuming that the figure or topic to be discussed is not nonsense or irrelevant but worth the time to wrestle through in order to be better equipped to dialogue about the philosophy concerning religion. The mods do not bear the sword for nothing, and in this case I would be making sure to weed out comments that do not contribute to constructive and cordial dialogue and debate.  The most obvious trend that appears to have cropped up is a growing number of contributors who are analytically-minded but unfamiliar with the vocabulary and major figures of continental philosophy, which is probably the dominant group of contributors in this subreddit. With that in mind, I think we could all benefit from some open discussions about things like the concept of God in particular schools of thought (death of God theology, postmodern theology, phenomenology, etc.), major figures in continental and analytic philosophy/theology (Hegel, Kierkegaard, Caputo, Plantinga, Wolterstorff, Marion, Derrida, etc.), and possibly certain narrations of recent historical movements in continental philosophy (I'm very partial to genealogies of thought, myself).  What are your thoughts? What would you be most interested in? Do you have a topic that you would like to share about or know more about?  **EDIT**: I know the downvoting speech is always unpopular, but please refrain from downvoting this post, as it would be helpful for more people in the subreddit to see it. If you do not wish to participate in this project, that's fine--say why, or leave the post be, but please do not downvote, as it does not give others the chance to see it for themselves. Thanks!","Upvoted!

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/theravada.jsonl,theravada.jsonl,12gnlkj,The role of the teacher in Theravada,"Hi! I am not super familiar with Theravada tradition so I am trying to understand this school. For example, is the role of the teacher as important as in other traditions? I know better zen/vajrayana context and in both the role of the master is central. In Vajrayana the Lama gives you initiation etc, in Zen the master gives you koans etc. You have to choose a master and pratice following mainly his/her teachings. And in both, at a certain point the master/lama/zen teacher recognizes the realizations of the lay practitioner.  So how does it works in Theravada? In order to properly  follow the Theravada way, should I find a Theravada teacher/monk first?  If the role is different, in wich ways it is so?  Thanks a lot! üôè","From my personal perception, Theravada Buddhism has less emphasis on having a teacher/guru than many other traditions. This is because the Pali Canon suttas are held in very high esteem within Theravada Buddhism as they are believed to contain the words of the Buddha.  Like in any facet of life, a skilled teacher can expedite one's practice and progress by giving immediate feedback. This can't be done by solo learning.  But so long as one has access to the Buddha's Dhamma (the suttas, thanks to the sangha preserving and practicing them) they are capable of learning it for themselves. Some people (usually from other traditions) say they're too complex to learn on one's own, but that isn't true. You can start with very brief teachings like the Dhammapada that have been read and practiced by millions around the world.  Dhammapada 76-77:  >""Regard him as one who points out treasure, The wise one who seeing your faults rebukes you. Stay with this sort of sage. For the one who stays with a sage of this sort, things get better, not worse.   >   >Let him admonish, instruct, deflect you away from poor manners. To the good, he's endearing; to the bad, he's not.""  The Buddha said no other external factor is as significant to the path as admirable friendship:  >As he was sitting there, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, ""This is half of the holy life, lord: admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie.""   >   >""Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, he can be expected to develop & pursue the noble eightfold path.   >   >""And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, develop & pursue the noble eightfold path? There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops right resolve...right speech...right action...right livelihood...right effort...right mindfulness...right concentration dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, develops & pursues the noble eightfold path.   >   >""And through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life: It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair have gained release from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair. It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how having admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life.""   >   >‚Äî SN 45.2","from the time of the Buddha there was no real guru/teacher dynamic, at least not for laity.   reason being is in ancient India people stayed in their villages, doing their farming, and wandering ascetics came and went through it.   in the suttas you see the Buddha as teacher, but he said when he passed on the Dhamma would be the teacher.   so there is an importance to be around wise people and to learn from them, but not in a guru way where your progress is through a teacher.  my preceptor, Bhante G, is one of the most famous theravada monastics in the west. One retreat he said ‚Äú i am not a teacher,there is only one teacher‚Äù he said pointing to the Buddha. then he said ‚Äú i can share the Dhamma and be a kalyana mitta , but you must follow the path‚Äù.   and i think that pretty much sums the Theravada perspective in general, but there are places in Theravada that do have a more guru centric style, like Thai Forest, but not to the same level as mahayana.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.6340973078

Many Jews opposed his accession.  His brutality soon manifested itself (Josephus‚Ä¶) and he was removed in A.D. 6 and banished.  Thenceforth Palestine was a small imperial province ruled by a procurator except in the time of King Herod Agrippa I (A.D. 41-44); see Acts 12:1-4, 20-23.‚Äù (Johnson, 1951, p. VII 261)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúHerod having put Antipater his eldest son to death, altered his will, and thus disposed of his dominions: he gave the tetrarchy of Galilee and Petrea to his son Antipas; the tetrarchy of Gaulonitis, Trachonitis, Batanea, and Paneadis, to this son Phillip; and left the kingdom of Judea to his eldest remaining son, Archelaus.  This son partook of the cruel and blood-thirsty disposition of his father; at one of the Passovers he caused three thousand of the people to be put to death in the temple and city.  For is tyranny and cruelty, Augustus deprived him of the government, and banished him‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;*He turned aside into the parts of Galilee*] Here Antipas governed, who is allowed to have been of a comparatively mild disposition; and being intent on building two cities, *Julias* and *Tiberias*, he endeavoured, by a mild carriage and promises of considerable immunities, to entice people from other provinces to come and settle in them. ‚Ä¶ this was a most favourable circumstance to the holy family ‚Ä¶ they dwelt in peace, safety, and comfort at Nazareth.‚Äù (Clarke, 1832, p. I 35)   &amp;nbsp;    -23. He came and settled in a city the called NahTsRahTh [‚ÄúOverlook‚Äù, Nazareth],   to purpose of [◊ú◊û◊¢◊ü, LeMah`ahN] realizing the said upon [the] mouth of the prophets:    ‚ÄúFor ‚ÄòNahTsReeY‚Äô [‚ÄúNazarene‚Äù] will be called to him.‚Äù    &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúMatthew apparently plays on words as the rabbis loved to do‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The village of Nazareth is not mentioned in any ancient records. ‚Ä¶ The village *en-Na·π£ira* is traditionally identified with Nazareth, no doubt correctly.‚Äù (Johnson, 1951, pp. VII 261-262)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúIt is difficult to ascertain by what prophets this was spoken.  The margin usually refers to Judg. [Judges] xiii. 5. where the angel, foretelling the birth of Samson, says, No razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a NAZARITE (◊†◊ñ◊ô◊® *nezir*) unto God from the womb.  The second passage usually referred to, is Isai. [Isaiah] xi. 1. There shall come forth a rod from the stem of Jesse, and a BRANCH (◊†◊¶◊® *netser*) shall grow out of his roots. ‚Ä¶ it is likely that before St. Matthew wrote this Gospel, those afterward called Christians, bore the appellation of Nazarites or Nazoreans, for so the Greek word ŒùŒ±Œ∂œâœÅŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ [*Nazoraios*].‚Äù   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Joseph, involved in the building trade, probably settled in Nazareth because he could find abundant work in neighboring Sepphoris, which Herod Antipas was re-building as his capital at that time.  The reference to a prophecy here poses a classic problem of interpretation since there is no exact correspondence to any known OT text.  Perhaps Matthew inserted it here to provoke the reader to consider a number of elements: (1) a reference to a little town not mentioned in the OT; (2) a reference to the messiah as a branch (*nƒì·π£er*) in Isa 11:1 and elsewhere; and, most interesting, (3) a reference to Jesus as a *nƒÅz√Ær*, ‚Äúconsecrated person,‚Äù in the line of Samson and Samuel‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶ Looking back over chaps. 1-2 we can see that Matt [Matthew] has introduced Jesus to the reader as Son of Abraham in the genealogy, son of God and Emmanuel in 1:18-25, Son of David in 2:1-12, a new Moses in 2:13-15, a new Jeremiah in 2:16-18, and a new Samson in 2:19-23.  He is the all-around savior figure.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The literary genre of these two chapters has been much discussed‚Ä¶ In recent decades it has become common to regard them as Jewish-Christian midrash [exposition] employing storytelling‚Ä¶ it doubtless employs midrashic techniques of exposition.  This means that in addition to some historical information there are also some legendary elements in the chapters‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;A close comparison of the narratives in Matt and Luke would yield 11 points in common‚Ä¶ The three most important are that Jesus is said to be a son of David (i.e. [in other words], of the tribe of Judah), born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth, and that he was conceived virginally.  It would be convenient to make these points the historical kernel of the narratives, but they are in fact at differing levels of historical probability.  The first has the highest chance of being historical.  Both the Bethlehem birth and the virginal conception are potentially so highly influenced by the authors‚Äô reading of OT [Old Testament; the Hebrew Bible] prophecy that the historian hesitates where the believer need not.  Yet it is more probable that the stories existed first without the formula citation than that the stories were created to encase them.  The five citations are Matthew‚Äôs contribution to the received tradition‚Ä¶ The early Christians recognized Jesus as Son of God first at his resurrection (Paul), then at his baptism (Mark), then at his conception (Matt/Luke).‚Äù (Viviano, 1990, p. 636)   &amp;nbsp;       **FOOTNOTES**    ^1 [Herod‚Äôs the Great‚Äôs family tree(https://www.geni.com/family-tree/index/6000000002428752488)   &amp;nbsp;    [An Amateur's Journey Through the Bible](https://bikingfencer.blogspot.com/2017/03/matthew-in-progress-chapter-2.html)","Star‚Äù Seen After Jesus‚Äô Birth. The ‚Äúastrologers from eastern parts,‚Äù hence from the neighborhood of Babylon, whose visit to King Herod after the birth of Jesus resulted in the slaughter of all the male infants in Bethlehem, were obviously not servants or worshipers of the true God. (Mt 2:1-18.) As to the ‚Äústar‚Äù (Gr., a¬∑ster π) seen by them, many suggestions have been given as to its having been a comet, a meteor, a supernova, or, more popularly, a conjunction of planets. None of such bodies could logically have ‚Äòcome to a stop above where the young child was,‚Äô thereby identifying the one house in the village of Bethlehem where the child was found. It is also notable that only these pagan astrologers ‚Äúsaw‚Äù the star. Their condemned practice of astrology and the adverse results of their visit, placing in danger the life of the future Messiah, certainly allow for, and even make advisable, the consideration of their having been directed by a source adverse to God‚Äôs purposes as relating to the promised Messiah. It is certainly reasonable to ask if the one who ‚Äúkeeps transforming himself into an angel of light,‚Äù whose operation is ‚Äúwith every powerful work and lying signs and portents,‚Äù who was able to make a serpent appear to speak, and who was referred to by Jesus as ‚Äúa manslayer when he began,‚Äù could not also cause astrologers to ‚Äòsee‚Äô a starlike object that guided them first, not to Bethlehem, but to Jerusalem, where resided a mortal enemy of the promised Messiah.‚Äã‚Äî2Co 11:3, 14; 2Th 2:9; Ge 3:1-4; Joh 8:44.",jesus once told me not to trust lucifer i just looked at him why is he tell me these things iam holier than most i live a very strict live i talk to jesus he waits a day or 2 then he tells me all these things,comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.3478001036

I have a few questions (nothing about steel or horses though) regarding the Mormon church's reputation and its tendency towards abuse.     As an individual, whether you be a current mormon, ex-mormon, or unaffiliated, how does the concept that physical, mental, emotional, and sexual abuse being common themes among mormon communities affect you?     Secondly, do you believe that abuse is common within mormon communities at all?     Thirdly, if you do believe that abuse within mormon communities is common, are you of the mentality that it only occurs in certain sects or is it prevalent in all sects?     Fourthly, if it were in your power to run the mormon community, how would you have it run? I want this to be much more open-ended, so please answer however you would like.     Thank you for taking your time to answer my questions.","I have studied and lived mormonism a fair bit, and also followed the Catholic and JW scandals.  Abuse does happen in mormonism, but I tend to think that the rates of sexual abuse are lower than the Catholics and JWs.  I cannot prove it.  The abuse which you tend to see in mormonism is parents disowning their kids or shaming their kids, esp. in the 1980s when their children were homosexuals.  This still occurs today, but with a lower frequency as the teachings have evolved.  In many ways, the Mormons are not dissimilar from evangelicals in this regard.  Those who leave the faith are not overtly shunned, but they are likely to experience negative reactions from family members and relationships are likely to suffer, sometimes greatly.  Mormonism tends to be similar to the JW and Adventists in terms of level of practice and the Evangelicals in terms of devotion to Republican and conservative values.  If you can blend those together in your mind, you will get a reasonable image of what to expect.

Do you think I've created a solid belief system?","The Church of the Holy Light Spirit (Spiraeism) is a faith that focuses on the connectivity of all living things through ""Spirit"", or the imprint of our personalities onto the Energy that drives Life. It uses the personification of the forces of ""Good"" and ""Evil"" to convey a message. I wrote a Holy Book for the faith, so sorry if this post is kind of long.  **Book 1 : Spirit**  In our world, there is an Energy. It is one of Life, a force that connects us all. It is called ""Spirit."" Every living thing has a spirit. It is the essence of Life, upon which our personalities imprint. Our individual spirits are interconnected to form ""*The* Spirit"", which is the main force in life that connects everyone and everything. The Spirit is inherently good, but can become tainted by the negativity of the fallen.  **Book 2 : The Personification of Spirit**  The Spirit is not a physical being, but is instead represented as a fair goddess. She is called The Holy ""Light Spirit."" She symbolizes all that is good, and righteous, and holy, and is what we should all strive to be like. However, there is also another: The Profane ""Dark Spirit."" He symbolizes bitterness, violence, and hatefulness. He is the Opposer to The Light Spirit, and is the opposite of what one should be like. He is the Evil to balance The Light Spirit's Good.  **Book 3 : Interactions**  As a matter of principle, there cannot be Light without Dark, or Good without Evil. And while the Good of The Light Spirit is certainly much more divine and bountiful than the Evil of the Dark Spirit, the two manage to cancel each other out to form a stable tranquility. Because, as it only takes a single malicious whisper to bring crashing down the nations, it takes the hard toiled effort of the right to protect and restore the nations.   **Book 4 : Reckonings and Rewards**  And for their services, the righteous will be rewarded. But it shall not be in gold and pearls, as the shallow beg for. Instead, it shall be in happiness, and prosperity, for remaining pure when being faced with temptations. And while the Dark Spirit is undoubtedly wicked and wrong, you will never be punished for mistakenly stumbling in the night. Nay, instead you will be guided out by the light of day, to recognize your mistakes, and work to reform. For The Light Spirit realizes that none are perfect, and that we all fall down occasionally. The Spirit will always be there to pick you back up and offer forgiveness.  **Origin/Afterlife:**  When the world first began, so did The Spirit. It is up to your own views as to what came before. When you die, your spirit will come back to The Spirit, where it will shatter, merge with other spirits, and reincarnate.  **Principles:**  The Church basically runs on a Golden Rule and Harm Principle rules list.  So, in a nutshell, Spirareism is basically Shinto and Native American religions put together with a few extra things added.  I'd appreciate any feedback you could give me, but I may be late replying to you, as it's 4:41 AM right now, and I'm sleep deprived. :P","Interesting, but I fail to understand how this is like Shinto or American beliefs.","In Shinto, the belief is that the influence of the Kami(divine nature spirits that represent various things) resides in everything.

My brother is the pastor of the church I once attended, and am still technically a member of. It's a very, very strict sect of Baptist. I talked to him about rescinding my membership (I'm not at all close with my brother, so it was a semi-hostile discussion), and he said that it has never been done before; either people move their memberships, or they are brought up in a deacon's meeting for ""denying the faith"" and are excluded.   My brother and I reached sort of a compromise-- women are not allowed to speak in business meetings; they must get a man to represent them. I proposed that I attend the deacon's meeting where they talk about my exclusion, and articulate my reasons for leaving, and be there when the exclude me. He said this made sense.  The deacon called me today to say that is not possible, and it would have to be brought up in a business meeting. I said ""okay, so I would be able to articulate my reason for leaving, because I'm a member and I'm speaking about my own membership. Right?""  ""Well... our procedure doesn't allow for that.""  ""Because I'm a woman.""  ""Yes, our procedure doesn't allow women to speak in business meetings. That's just how it is.""  ""I made a conscious decision to join the church, I should be able to make a conscious decision to leave it. You're saying that a legally consenting adult in the state of Maryland cannot talk in a church business meeting because your sexist procedures don't allow for it?""  ""well, I can speak for you. To say, you know, that for whatever reason you've suddenly decided god doesn't exist anymore.""  ""I am a member of your church, I deny your doctrines, your god, and your procedures. This is not a sudden decision; I've been trying to get my membership off your books for almost five years now. I would like to articulate my own reason.""  ""Well, you can't do that.""  After several minutes of this, he gave me a ""well, if you don't want to be involved in the proceedings (...how *CAN* I be? They won't let me talk!) we'll just go on with the exclusion without you, since obviously what you're describing to me is that you don't believe in god and that is grounds for exclusion. But you're always welcome to come back.""  I gave him a cheerful ""I won't, and this is part of the reason why I'm attempting to severe all affiliation with your church in the first place. Goodbye.""  I called my brother to re-discuss the compromise we'd talked about before, and he went all hardened christian asshole on me. No, you can't attend the meeting, no, you can't talk in business meeting, all you want to do is make some statement and cause a scene, and we can't allow that. Just quietly be excluded.  It angers me that they won't let me have a say in my own membership because of my gender. It angers me that they're perpetuating their bigotry, and my brother will raise his kids this way, and the cycle of ignorance will just keep going.  It angers me that reason has no effect whatsoever on them. And it never will, because they propagate this ignorance and block out everything else. Fuck this, fuck churches, fuck religion.

So i would like to share my way of breaking someone out of fundamentalist Christianity, since it worked for me. When i was 14, i forced myself to believe in a lot of nonsense out of the fear of hell. When i was 16, i started to question the nonsense and became more liberal by learning it at Rationalwiki. I also learned how Got Questions (all all fundamentalists) either demonize or misrepresents positions that they didn't like. As a result i started to trust my rational mind more and question many fundamentalist ideas like pro life and embraced antinatalism (if you believe the abrahamic hell exists then procreation creates eternal danger).  Summery: To free fundamentalists, you need to show them how their ministry/pastor uses strawman, along other fallacies. This should make them questions their trust and encourage them to trust their logic. They will then become independantly thinking/liberal Christians.  Former fundamentalists, did you break out the same way i did?  Edit: Also what nonsense did you buy while in fundamentalism?",You changed your mind about a thing that you believed. I suspect that beliefs that are forced upon oneself are a bit easier to alter.,"I got out in the 90‚Äôs, so none of those resources were available. I recognize a much larger role for pre-rational social effects in my own deconversion:   I think it started with reading golden age SF, and being exposed to a world where scientific inquiry, educated guesses, and hard work were the way to solve hard problems; not petitioning deities and having faith.  Once I had this alternate model of the world sufficiently fleshed out, it became obvious it held together better,  raised fewer questions, explained the world without all the unnecessary degrees of freedom that a deity-based explanation has. So I just switched models.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/Talmud.jsonl,Talmud.jsonl,bcmt8t,Why Does the Talmud promote these things,"There are a lot of really weird things written in the Talmud For Example: And Reish Lakish says: A gentile who observed Shabbat is liable to receive the death penalty, as it is stated: ‚ÄúAnd day and night shall not cease‚Äù (Genesis 8:23), which literally means: And day and night they shall not rest. And the Master said (57a) that their prohibition is their death penalty, i.e., the punishment for any prohibition with regard to descendants of Noah is execution. Ravina says: If a descendant of Noah observes a day of rest on any day of the week, even one not set aside for religious worship, e.g., on a Monday, he is liable. And Rabbi Yo·∏•anan says: A gentile who engages in Torah study is liable to receive the death penalty; as it is stated: ‚ÄúMoses commanded us a law [torah], an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob‚Äù (Deuteronomy 33:4), indicating that it is an inheritance for us, and not for them. And Rabbi ·∏§anina says: One who slaps the cheek of a Jew is considered as though he slapped the cheek of the Divine Presence; as it is stated: ‚ÄúIt is a snare [mokesh] for a man to rashly say [yala]: Holy‚Äù (Proverbs 20:25). The verse is interpreted homiletically to mean: One who strikes [nokesh] a Jew is considered as though he hurt the cheek [lo‚Äôa] of the Holy One. Rabbi ·∏§anina says: A gentile who struck a Jew is liable to receive the death penalty, as it is stated when Moses saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew: ‚ÄúAnd he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand‚Äù (Exodus 2:12). Rav Huna says: A gentile is permitted to marry his daughter. And if you say, for what reason did Adam not marry his daughter? It was so that Cain would marry his sister, because it is stated: ‚ÄúThe world shall be built on kindness.‚Äù Rav ·∏§isda says: A Canaanite slave is permitted to marry his mother, and he is permitted to marry his daughter. This is because he has left the category of a gentile by immersing in a ritual bath for the purpose of becoming a slave to a Jew, and consequently all his previous family relationships are disregarded according to halakha But if so, let the tanna count this prohibition among the seven Noahide mitzvot. The Gemara explains: According to the one who says that the verse is referring to the Torah as an inheritance, this prohibition is included in the prohibition of robbery, as a gentile who studies Torah robs the Jewish people of it. The punishment of a gentile who studies Torah is like that of one who engages in intercourse with a betrothed young woman, which is execution by stoning. Why Does the Talmud promote these things? Why does it say that assaulting a jew is no different than assaulting God, why does it call for the execution of non-jews simply for observing the Shabbat or studying the Torah?","Too many questions to involve myself with.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/Reformed.jsonl,Reformed.jsonl,gyt9oe,"Just having lots of thoughts, maybe lost, unsure, many questions","I honestly don't know where to start, I just want to let this out. When I look at my life, I am still not sure how I got to this point. When I was around 3 years old not sure, I fell from a double deck bed. I still have this vivid memory of me falling, then just before hitting the ground I felt someone put something behind my head, a cardboard like object to protect my head from the impact.  Then I shortly saw this image of what seemed like an angel like figure. Then I became unconscious. I usually ask this story to my family just for me to know what they saw as I was laying on the floor, and even they say that they were surprised how my head was protected  when I fell.   When I was around 5, I was diagnosed with epilepsy and I took medications for this until I was around 11, when my brain scan gave out a normal reading. Thankfully, I only experienced seizures around 2 or 3 times but the medication and its side effects affected me mentally.   In highschool, I started having this sudden curiosity on faith and Christianity. It was sort of a weird time of me, I was starting to know more about faith and this was the first time I understood the concept of salvation by grace through faith. Up to this day I am still not sure what prompted me to be interested, as this happened very suddenly.Looking back I would say my theology is not that refined as I would just be sharing random christian posts on facebook and watch anything Christian on Youtube, but the interest and curiosity were undeniable. Around this same time, I was also heavily delving deeper into conspiracy theories and such. I was also having some serious mental and emotional problems, not sure if it were because of my withdrawal of my antipsychotic medication or if it was some sort of a religious experience. Up to this day, I still am unsure about this and think about it sometimes.   Right before going to college, I went into some sort of an agnostic phase. During this time I thought I would be relieved from my mental and emotional troubles if I stop delving into religion and faith. I thought maybe I would be free of my problems but they actually got worse. Because of this I went back to being involved with Christianity, started becoming more serious with faith, reading books and listening to sermons. For the first time i attended fellowship meetings, became affliated with a campus parachurch ministry, started sharing the gospel to family and friends. I felt that I really was being shaped and transformed spiritually, that I was understanding more and more of Jesus, the cross, and the whole story and state of humanity and the world, things I don't usually ponder about. I was convinced I was saved and I was being sanctified because of my increasing involvement with the faith. But still I realize my emotional and mental troubles were becoming worse so I got psychiatric help, tried medication but did not help. I contemplated suicide a few times, struggled with lust, anger, depression, anxiety.   With this desire to change I started to doubt how I perceive myself. Sometimes I feel that I have progressed but then realizing it was not so. Because of this doubt my mental and emotional states were affected and I started to feel really helpless.   I always have this feeling of some eerie sense of wrong, with my family, with myself and with others. I constantly evaluate myself, I also evaluate my family and how they behave. I have this belief that our family have some sort of problem with ego, feelings of hurt, etc..maybe narcissistic tendencies. When I try to address concerns with them, they seem to deny this and always say that everything is fine. Because of this, I sometimes think that maybe they are right and I am the one who is being crazy. Still, this unsettling feeling won't go away which always leads me to into these deep thought patterns that something is wrong, this feeling of hoping that someday healing and restoration would happen. Being the only professing christian in our family certaintly adds to this burden, sometimes I am tempted to blame my faith for feeling this way and being in this state. Sometimes I also tend to blame my family for being this way, because of them maybe not seeing what I am discerning. I also sometimes hoped of just denying this reality which I know and live life as if everything is fine, but something just seemed to prevent me from doing so. I identify this as maybe the Spirit that keeps me and helps me persevere.   I know what I wrote is very long but I just want to express myself. I somewhat struggle to do this to people I know, even Christians I know, which is why I went here to do it. I am hoping if you have time to pray for my sanity, my battle with sinful patterns, that I may be fully free from pornography and masturbation (almost 6 months clean as of today), that God would grant me peace that transcends all understanding and that He would keep me and not let me fall away. God bless everyone.","The first thing I wonder are you baptized? Because it is after baptism that I calmed down more and more. And I've been on a wild rollercoaster, believe me, it was wild.  It was after my baptism that I was able to look at myself in my relationship that I experience with Jesus and the Lord God. In your story I recognize the reproach to yourself and to the family. I too am the only one baptized in my family. The guilt questions and the reproaches to the people around you and to yourself will become less and less. Just reading and thinking about the Bible daily gave me a lot of peace in my head and in my daily actions. I do not hear in your story that you fully choose for Christ. It was after I was completely mentally bankrupt and I had no choice but to cry on my knees and admit that I couldn't do it on my own. After that I was baptized and the difference between that man then and the man I am now is clearly visible. Rest in my life, peaceful and above all rest in the head. That is not to say that I no longer have a daily struggle, there is. But much less and more focused on what the Lord wants from me, rather than the constant sins I committed. My advice to the extent that I have read your story is to surrender to the Lord, pray to Him to draw you to Him. I will pray that the Lord will increase your faith.","Thank you for your prayers. I am not baptized but I plan to once this pandemic ends. With regard to fully choosing Christ, I guess it did not seem that way in what I wrote but I think I came to a point where I did surrender myself to Him. I would say it was after the agnostic phase. I guess my mind is just cluttered and I admit struggling to clearly articulate what I want to say and what goes in my mind.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.4435337435

I am a dual citizen, country 1 is relatively all Muslim and its where I was born and grew up in, my family is all here. Country 2 is a western country, I moved there years back. I ended up buying a house on mortgage, it was my primary residence. Due to some circumstances, I've moved back to country 1 and have no plans on leaving as of now. I ended up renting out the mortgaged house. After paying the mortgage I get $18/month as profit from the rent.  I have been told that the mortgage is Riba. So I have been thinking of selling it, but I just want to do the right thing according to my Deen. But I am unsure if it is indeed Riba. What do you say?  When I bought the house initially, I was told it wouldn't be considered as Riba bcoz that's kind of the only way to buy a house in western countries.","The fact that its a western country doesnt all of a sudden mean its not riba. Its quite clear that its riba akhi. You would consider the same exAct mortgage to be riba somewhere else, but not in a Muslim country?  I think what you mean to say is that riba loans for houses are not *haram* in western countries or whatever. In which i still disagree with. Nobody is forcing you to buy a house. You can easily just rent like millions of other people do.  What excuse will you give to AllƒÅh ‚Äòazza wajal on yaumul qiyamah for comitting one of the seven destructive sins?

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/theravada.jsonl,theravada.jsonl,112jsqh,"I really don't understand Rebirth, and how it can exist along with Anatta?","Pretty much the title.  How can anything be reborn, when there is nothing to us? We are without substance, just a compilation of aggregates that pass away upon death. Without a Self, which I agree seems true, how can Rebirth take place? What is reborn, if we - consciousness, form, etc. - is nothing?   I really just don't understand how to reconcile the two, and how Rebirth could work in general. Are there any resources / suttas that could help me?  Thanks!","Are you sure that the notion of self is a necessary component for rebirth? If so, why?   To answer your question, it's our karmic tendencies that are reborn.  A karmic footprint, if you will.  Karma is the carrying force that turns the wheel of rebirth, and it is clinging to notions of self that bind us to the wheel.  Something that might help with your cognitive dissonance is knowing that the Buddha never said what we are.  What he does say is that whatever we can conceive of as a self is unworthy of being called a self, and will never come close to what we truly are.  So although it is a pointless exercise to contemplate what we are, the fact that we cling to this self view makes it necessary to consider what we *are not* in order to break up this view, and for this, the Buddha recommends applying the perception of not-self to our experience;  it is through negation of the self view that we uproot it.  (Just as when we wish to cease from hatred, he would have us practice not-hatred, ie., love.)  When we learn about the concept of no self, the tendency is to conceive of a new identity that is in line with this teaching.  This is better than the alternative, but the issue that the Buddha was pointing to was really that it is this very desire to construct new identities that is the fundamental delusion at the heart of suffering.  This is because when we construct a sense of self in relation to some desirable notion or object, we will only be able to keep it up until something new catches our eye, at which point we shed this identity and acquire another for some other purpose, and everything we are/believe/hold dear within this present identity disappears.  To put it simply, who or what you are is not as stable as you think it is and should not be relied upon or mistaken as a constant.  Who you are changes according to your desires in a given moment, which  themselves change almost every time your attention moves.  If you wish to observe this for yourself, then observe the movements of your attention. You will notice that what you want changes according to what you observe, and who you are is the result of who you think you need to be in order to do something with what you're observing.  If we create identities out of ignorance of these facts, then suffering follows.  If we construct identities with knowledge of these facts, then not only is there significantly less attachment involved (we are using identities, rather than being used by them), but they can become tools for developing the path.  Once you see that there is an element of choice in how you use your attention (and, consequently, how you construct identities), you realize that you have the power and even duty to develop as many skillful states and qualities as possible.    And that's what this path of practice is... A collection of highly useful ideas that guide us in our effort to generate skillful states of being.  As we take on more skillful identities, we eventually reach a point where the act of creating anything at all seems tedious and unnecessary, and the possibility that we drop it altogether arises.  This is the moment of liberation.   Until we achieve liberation, our desire for continued existence (new identities) will propel us into our next life in accordance with our karma.","Rebirth happens when there is clinging and craving for a self.   Anicca is observable. We notice things change, come and go. Impermanence. Our self, opinions, likes and dislikes change so much in our life. So many versions of our identity died, reborn, die again. How is there a permanent self when the self has changed so much in the course of our lives. When the self is changing so much, how can there be a self. What is a self if there is no actual basis or independent existence. The self that is dependent on a whole chain of other aspects to exist is not a self worth identifying with.   The anatta that matters, the Anicca that is to be investigated are on the things and identities in life you hold dear. Are we really accepting and seeing the impermencece of these associations and attachments we have in our own lives, or do we neglect this truth and act in delusion to assume all the things we hold dear are permanent unchanging and independent entities in the universe.   A more skillful way of living arises from realizing Anicca, anatta, and dukkha property in existence.   Many intellectually understand and accept these ideas. But it takes actual practice and deep reflection, mind free from hinderences to experience these truths and see the  dharma clearly.   Rebirth will happen if one has achieved arahanthood/ enlightenment, because the passing of the body is not the end of consciousness of that being. Without the body, the karmic cravings and attachments still carry into the next realm it is shaped towards. Where it is headed is dependent on the character/ karma of the person.   We already see human beings shaped in various ways in this life according to their deeds and intention. And their mental qualities head towards a certain experience in their lives; regardless of their material or physical condition.   Enlightenment is possible because of the truth of anatta.  But it needs to be realized.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.1691853554

Sometimes I would stay quiet and let it be, mostly because I don‚Äôt really want to cause any trouble and escalate the unfairness. I‚Äôd rather just stick to the Right Speech. So I just deal with it and hope that I could endure it somehow.   I‚Äôm not an assertive person in general, I just go with the flow and try to reduce the resistance as much as I could, so sometimes I feel that people do take advantage of me. I am able to let go of such unfairness most of the time, for my peace of mind, but sometimes it‚Äôs not easy.   The more I see into Buddhism, the more I feel that these are very trivial matters and that on a grand scale the samsara is infinitely times more unfair than what we have to deal with in this life. So maybe I think that seeing the big picture, made me less assertive.   I understand that we are afflicted by anger, greed and delusions, and I do understand the eight worldly winds and try to stay in equanimity in times of unfairness. But sometimes I do feel that if I was able to be more assertive, I could lessen the suffering that I do have to deal with due to some peoples‚Äôs unfair self-centered means, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure, since I feel that being assertive perpetuates the self-view so I‚Äôd just rather accept the unfair situations as it is and let go of it eventually.

One day while basking in the sun he noticed a woman nearby collecting  sticks  for the household fire. Rather than slither away or stand erect with his hood open so as to scare her, as had been his habit, he decided to remain where he was and radiate metta to the woman. She got closer and closer until she had collect enough sticks and then began looking around for something to tie them up with. Seeing the cobra and  mistaking him  for a piece of vine she picked him up by the tail, gave him a violent  flick,  wrapped him several times around the sticks, pulled him tight and then tied him in a knot. Then she put the bundle on her head and walked home. When she got there she untied the ‚Äòvine‚Äô and threw it away. Battered, bent and wincing with pain the poor cobra made his way back to the hermitage and told the  monk  what had happened. ‚ÄúYou tell me to cultivate metta and this is what I get for it‚Äù he complained mournfully. The monk replied:  ‚ÄúJust because you have metta doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt sometimes hiss.‚Äù  So, on the one hand, you could try practicing metta towards your colleagues but, on the other hand, you can also clearly state your boundaries (""hiss""), especially if you're mindful that it's not motivated by aversion but from the necessity to protect yourself.",comment_1,"Lacks Constructive Dialogue,

I‚Äôm realizing that certain things....at least now cannot be answered but I‚Äôm also realizing that even if Jesus was proven not to be the messiah....even if heaven and God were proven to not be real but just figments of the human mind....I‚Äôd still pursue and want to be a Christian.  Because I‚Äôm starting to see Christianity as more than just a religion...it‚Äôs also a beautiful philosophy. I‚Äôm not talking about those people who ruin it by killing in its name.

But usually there comes a point when things start to click, when things become real, when you can't imagine not going to church, that Christ takes whatever drew us into the church originally, and converts that into a true faith. It takes time, trust, and love!  So is that a valid mindset to approach the Church with, sure!

My parents were practicing, but not strict, and my maternal grandmother is neither Catholic, nor religious.) I have been welcomed by some individuals, but told by many that I will never be a true Jew because it is ethnic and cultural, and that, in not having Jewish blood, a rabbi would be far less eager to convert me than a lapsed person born Jewish who looked Jewish. (I have heard this and variations multiple times.

To complicate my feelings, I am dating an atheist man who is not Jewish and only a reform rabbi will consider allowing me to convert. My partner is supportive, but hates the pain this decision is causing me. He's a good man and I love him. I do not believe that religion and love must be matched, nor will I ever. He has stood by me through a painful and complex disease that is most likely genetic and, frankly, I need a man who will stick around and be supportive in tough times, as I try to do for those I love.

It gave me comfort, but at the same time, it gave me guilt. As I see it, the symptoms of BPD are not what children of God should have. I understand how in Romans it says that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ, but out of nowhere, I have this constant feeling of emptiness and abandonment. It's just totally opposite of what I should feel. I also have intense mood swings that really interferes with how I worship through the Word and prayer, and even how I relate with people around me. Everyday is a battle and there are just days I give up. There are days I don't have any motivation to live. There are days I wake up fine, but end up feeling so terrible. There are days I feel happy, and then suddenly, I'd get angry and frustrated, then I'm fine, then I'm sad. Most of the days, I don't know who I am (but I know as I read the Scripture that I am a loved child of God, I am elected before the foundation of the world. This should be an encouragement, right? But there are many days I don't feel like it's true). It's so tiring.  I just also discovered about having an FP (favorite person), that is common among BPD patients, and that explained why I have broken relationships with people close to me. This feels so wrong because knowing how Jesus redeemed us already from sin and how the Spirit unites the believers in church and how He will produce the fruit of the Spirit to us, I feel so bad for feeling opposite. But I can't control it. There is so much guilt and sadness, because I can't remember choosing to feel this way.  By the way, I had 2 therapists, and I didn't feel satisfied with them. I specifically chose Christian therapists, but nahh. I don't want to sound rude, but I don't think they have sound doctrine. One therapist even advised me to do the Law of Attraction (like say to myself everyday ""My nose is beautiful"", ""I have a wonderful face"", etc). I just don't think that's biblical because our worth is in Jesus, and we are being sanctified into the image of Christ everyday.  And I also felt they're insincere because I'm paying for them to talk with me for at most 1 hr.   I have few people in family and church as support system, but I don't think they're enough. I tried to reach out and be open, but I just felt there's a limit to their service since they are not medical people, because helping people with BPD is very, very tiring. I know they love me and are really concerned, but there are times I just don't feel like it. I feel like the more I talk, the more reason they to leave me. I know that's irrational, but honestly, I think all of the biblical truths are in my head, but I feel different.   I would appreciate your encouragements and prayers. Thank you very much!","You are doing a great job on the encouragement--you see the tension between your temptation to give in to your symptoms and your faith. And you battle and some days you give up, and some days you succeed--this is the Christian life, and you are living it.   Those who have personality disorders have something like a blind spot. In significant ways, you cannot perceive reality the way other people do. However, a PD does not control God's ability to communicate with you. It is a natural, not a supernatural, problem. You may grow to have a deep, intimate relationship with God that may dwarf your ability to relate to people and navigate relationships with us. Neither you or God is hindered by this PD in your intimacy with him.   I want to speak to the people who read your post and thought, ""Man, that sounds hard, I don't identify with that battle!"" You need to wake up to the real world. This person has been forced to live in the real world by God's sovereign hand. You and I, we can often ignore the battle of the flesh and sin but they cannot. If they do, they hurt themselves and others profoundly.   So do we. Our sin is damaging ourselves and others, and we just pretend it isn't so bad.   This person knows how bad it is to give in to the flesh. It's time we listen to them, and believe them, and heed their warnings. Because maybe it's the rest of us with the blind spot.","Thank you so much for recognizing this post and encouraging me! This means a lot. I agree with you regarding how we must listen others experiencing PD. That was actually my goal, and I tried doing it these, but whenever I do, I come to a point I feel I'm getting too much negativity, and I just end up getting drained, because I'm not even fixed enough to help others.

This in turn should drive individuals and their actions toward paths leading to a neutral or acceptable standing with this higher power. Yet at the core of these religious ideals is an understanding and acceptance of their fellow man which should supersede/ tie-in to almost all other specific teachings regardless of point-of-view or idealistic difference of opinion. In short, acceptance and love of your fellow man, regardless of their point of view, is key and critical to almost all else for individual 'salvation' if you will.   Science/secular knowledge, more or less as a whole, ties human the experience  through uncovered truths and facts discovered by human involvement and interaction with the perceivable world around them. These facts, despite their finality, entropy, or 'heartless' nature, create a logical core on which character can be based. This in turn should lead to a perception that despite belief, this life, these moments are so precious based on the whole of existence, transcend petty barriers of idealism like religion. Focus then should be tied to relationships and human experience regardless of beliefs that would otherwise impede this small existence. In short, science should lead to a transcending focus on character and bettering the human experience rather than stop on trivial matters like religious belief or current social trends.   In light of this growing agnosticism, a new light of understanding has blossomed in my mind about why I feel the way I do at this point in my life about life.   I'd wager to believe that if religious proponents spent less time focusing on converting others to a belief in a god or higher power and more time understanding and loving their fellow man, we as a society could transcend the religious divide that engulfs us and become a society engaged in others. This would automatically align religions to a state-of-mind that would help humanity and not divide it.   I'd also wager that if science proponents spent less time and energy in the quest or answers against religion, focus would be returned to the pursuit of answers to help humanity and improve the human experience. Extreme atheism and intolerance is as contradictory and detrimental to scientific progress as religious fundamentalism. Science, without this prejudice, would then help and nurture the human experience by providing answers to human issues to help prolong human existence.   TL;DR  In summation, transcending current idealism for religion or science specifically would create a new common ground of understanding, thought, and humanity. Acceptance of anyone willing to use their beliefs for the good of society and to prolong humanity, is key to the ultimate survival of the human race. Certain traits like death and entropy are currently inevitable despite all belief or knowledge. Rhetorically,  Isn't it time to place the future of our existence into a system of progressive behavior and acceptance that leads to balance and understanding?","Mind, your points about religion are only applicable to a subset.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/PCUSA.jsonl,PCUSA.jsonl,etgztv,A few questions from a seeker,"I apologise in advance if this seems a bit rambly. I am originally from the UMC but went on a bit of a hiatus from Christianity because of some personal tensions I felt due to my sexuality. Here recently, I have reverted back into the Christian faith and have been attending a PC(USA) church and I love the people there. They've been nothing but kind and welcoming to me and have made it clear that they are an open and affirming church. I've run into a recent stumbling block though here recently in regards to a few theological positions commonly associated with Presbyterian/Reformed theology, particularly the 5 points of Calvinism. Growing up in a Wesleyan church, but studying Reformed theology as well has left me with a mixture of positions I accept from both sides. The trouble I am having comes from specifically the doctrines of Limited Atonement and Irresistible Grace. I have definitely come to understand Total Depravity (As it is a doctrine shared with the UMC) as well as Preservation of the Saints, and I suppose broadly Unconditional Election seeing as I personally believe predestination is simply God's divime foreknowledge of who would accept and who would reject his offer of salvation. But Limited Atonement and Irresistible Grace have given me a bit of a hangup as to me it seems to imply that God does not give the opportunity of salvation to everyone and chooses to create people simply with the intention of damning them. I have found it very difficult to reconcile this with my belief in God's love for all humankind and his willingness that none should perish, and that all come to salvation. Perhaps one would even call me a universalist for the hope that God's sovereign love could potentially provide a means of salvation to all people, whether in this life or in the next. Would my beliefs still fall under accepted Reformed/PC(USA) thought, seeing as I do accept most of the other Reformed ideas aside from these two? Or perhaps I am just overthinking all of this?","IMHO (as a Prssbyterian pastor), 5 points Calvinists are a fundamentalist version of Calvinists. We Presbyterians tend to like Calvin more than we like Calvinists. You probably have nothing to worry about from your church.  To be a member of a PC(USA) church (which lets to vote on its future), we don't even ask that you agree with reformed doctrine; you just have to affirm your faith as follower of Christ.  To be a leader (deacon/elder) however, you have to promise to be guided by our confessions and affirm that they are an authentic example of Christian faith. Note: this still does not mean you agree with everything in our confessions, but it might be good if you found one you liked. We sometimes call ourselves a ""big tent"" tradition because we don't expect ideological conformity and we value making room for many perspectives.   If you want a rundown of classic Reformed belief, check out the Westminster Shorter Catechism. If you want something more modern, check out our Confession of 1967 or our Brief Statement of Faith.  Many of the classic Reformed themes carry through, but they take a different form. The sovereignty of God as a broad theme is far more important to us than than predestination, for example. We also strongly hold to the priesthood of all believers, which is reflected in a church government. We don't like things that pretend to be God (idols). We like to say that we are ""Reformed and always in need of continuing to be reformed"" which means we expect our tradition to be dynamic as God teaches us new things in every generation.",I think this article does a great job of working through some of the issues you bring up:  https://www.presbyterianmission.org/what-we-believe/predestination/,comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.999373417

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/pagan.jsonl,pagan.jsonl,4vk08h,"I have decided to give Paganism a try, need help starting out?","After some thought I have decided to learn more about paganism but I am at a lost at where to begin. Here is where I currently stand with my beliefs.  I believe reincarnation is true. I don't believe in cross species reincarnation. I believe that NDE's show that that multiple religions could possibly be true, seeing as some people will see Jesus, others Muhammad, some Buddha, and various other worlds and dieties. So no one religion holds the ""true"" path. The way I see it, either all the ancient religions have some truth in them, or none do. I don't think Wicca is for me because as far as I can tell (no offense to any Wiccans) Wicca is just a bunch of cobbled up mythologies by some crazy guy in the 50s.  With that out of the way, where should I begin? What books do you reccomend. Websites to visit? What are some major pagan religions today? Where do you think my beliefs would put me? And lastly, should I just choose a path whose mythology/religion interest me or should I put more thought into it than that? (For example, I always had a passing interest in Norse and, even though according to this page is not pagan, Shinto.) Should I only chose a path based on my ancestory? I havent done much research but as far as I can tell, I come from an Irish line (lightly mixed with some Native American) Would it be cultural appropriation if I took up a different path?","&gt;Should I only chose a path based on my ancestory?  No. Lot's of people follow traditions different from the ones of their ancestors.  &gt;Would it be cultural appropriation if I took up a different path?  Not for any dead religion that you are reconstructing/reviving/renewing/what-have-you. For religions that haven't died, just be careful and respectful.  You may wish to check out /r/shinto. Paganism technically refers to all non abrahamic faiths, so Shinto is technically pagan. But this is a page for *contemporary* paganism, which is only for the modern religious movement.  &gt;And lastly, should I just choose a path whose mythology/religion interest me or should I put more thought into it than that?  Depends on what interests you about it and how much it overlaps with your reasons for joining. I love the aesthetic of the Norse world, with a world tree, a rainbow bridge, man being created from trees. But nothing about their gods really resonates with me. Therefore I don't get involved with that faith.  You seem to stress universalism (No one true path) and reincarnation. Only polytheistic traditions I am aware of with reincarnation are Hinduism and Orphism. There may be others, I don't know. I would also check out your local Unitarian Universalist church, and see if they have a pagan group.   &gt;What are some major pagan religions today?  All of the following are my brief summations of religious movements I am not a part of. Anyone of these traditions is welcome to extrapolate.  Wicca - Magical tradition that allows for combination of various pantheons Asatru/Heathenism - Worship of the Norse gods. Romuva - Worship of the Baltic gods. Celtic Reconstructionism - Worship of the Celtic gods. Greco-Roman Polytheism - Worship of the Greco Roman gods. Kemeticism - Worship of the Egyptian gods.  There are of course people who fall under one of the above categories and would reject the label, and people who would use those labels who would reject its description. Welcome to paganism.  There are other distinctions that occur that are more ideological than sectarian.  Theist vs Atheist - Whether or not someone actually believes in the gods  Soft polytheist vs Hard polytheist - Whether one thinks that there are infinite gods or there are one or two with many face. There are pagans who fall outside of this dichotomy, such as monotheists and people who think their pantheon is the only true one, others are simply wrong.  Modern vs Traditional - Harder divide to explain. Some pagans are using it to revive ""traditional"" ideas. These pagans tend to view their religion as ethnic, may disagree with the more liberal, modern ideologies (e.g. gay marriage), and hold hardline stances. Modern pagans will usually pick gods that work better for them as opposed to their heritage, may believe that the gods have ""updated"" to our society, or even that the gods were socially liberal before we were.   &gt;What books do you reccomend.  Narrow down your search query. What are you wanting to get from a book?","I think /u/Fabianzzz summed up everything quite nicely.  Well, why not explore your Irish heritage? Celtic Reconstructionism might peak your interest. Or why not give Hellenism a try? If you're interesting in learning more about Orphism you may have to travel to Greece to be initiated. (I'm unsure how that would work, though.) I stumbled upon a website claiming to be a genuine strain here in the United States, but since there's no definitive proof Orphism survived, take it with a grain of salt.

I‚Äôve long considered this but my motivations have always been tainted until recently.  I am an American, and I have some debt, not a considerable amount but still enough that it will take years to pay off.  My view on this has been something along the lines of ‚Äúto try to get to that point more quickly than I will is a form of self-grasping‚Äù.  Today a bird flew in front of my car and i am pretty sure it died on impact.  Considering this made me wish to never drive a car again, it‚Äôs silly to need to be somewhere so fast, but with the conditions within America it‚Äôs essentially compulsory.  I think, ‚ÄúI could just give it up, allow karma to take place, lose my home etc etc‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think this is anymore useful than continuing as I am.  Mostly because many of my actions would still revolve around keeping this body alive and safe, and largely would be less efficient or effective in doing so as i would have less resources to contribute to the world around me.  Another factor is that I have a dog, we have lived together for 6 years and he is very attached and bonded to me and I am fairly certain it would cause him a lot of suffering if I were to disappear from his life.  I also keep him alive by means of my job and providing his food and exercise and what not, so there is that as well.  I understand he has his own being and karma and all that but it doesn‚Äôt seem like a very compassionate way of dealing with it.  My main aspiration in monastic life would be to have more time and space for meditation practice, as well as being taught and inevitably teaching (if by no other means than existing).  I am hoping to hear from someone who might have had a similar experience and to hear how they navigated this.  Balancing the practical with the sublime I suppose.","What is the motivation?  You will never be a teacher. If you're already looking forward to that, inevitably, you can't be a good guide.  If you took discouragement in that, then you really never will be a teacher. Think closely on this.  &gt;Today a bird flew in front of my car and i am pretty sure it died on impact.  Yes, it did. What of the ants you stepped on today? Should you stop walking because you've killed them? They are sentient beings, the same as us. You didn't intent the bird to die, and it's intentional actions, not just cause and effect, random happenings, that make up Karma.  &gt;Another factor is that I have a dog, we have lived together for 6  years and he is very attached and bonded to me and I am fairly certain  it would cause him a lot of suffering if I were to disappear from his  life.  Not a dog. A Bodhisattva. He has taught you a lot and loves you. Don't look at love as attachment. That's not the teaching of the Buddha.  &gt;I understand he has his own being and karma and all that but it doesn‚Äôt seem like a very compassionate way of dealing with it.  It's not!  &gt;The logistics of joining a monastery as an westerner  You are not a westerner. You're limiting your own mind with this term. If this is your identity perception, it will hold you back, especially if you meet ""asians"". See? Another limited definition, which should be regarded as ""not me"".  Race is not a factor of the Triple Gem. Country is not a factor. Past is not a factor. Job is not a factor.  &gt;I am an American, and I have some debt, not a considerable amount but still enough that it will take years to pay off.  In the Vinaya, the Buddha was clear that one should have debts, which could cause problems with the law, wiped away or paid off.  &gt;My main aspiration in monastic life would be to have more time and space for meditation practice   Do you have a meditation practice at home?","Thank you.  I don‚Äôt aspire to teach specifically, I observe that we are all teachers. I would never seek to become a teacher.  Perhaps my conveyance was lacking.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/atheism.jsonl,atheism.jsonl,ukfi98,There is no God or Divine Right,"Worse than the following of religion due to believing that God gave revelation to special people, prophets, is the belief that God is personal and speaks and engages with every person. To take God out of the context of religious authority, unleashes a monster. For a person to claim they have had revelatory experiences and have experienced the divine nature of God, to accept that, is quite unbelievable.  As Hitchens debated Sharpton, Sharpton consistently claimed to have had experiences with God and to know, with certainty, that God exists. Hitchens never called him out as a charlatan and deceiver. I cannot wrap my head around this. Of course there is no need for personal attack. Yet, if you claim to get morality from God, and then claim that the Bible is fallible and man made and that you cannot base religion on believers. It begs the question, where are you getting your morality from? Simply, you are claiming that you know the nature of God and thus know what is moral and what is not. Simply, you are claiming divine authority. I cannot have that  Simply, complex morality is man made based off of already innate drives. There is an innate drive to love our offspring as ourself, through experience in the world, we learned that this should extend to our neighbor. Through experience in this world we learned that we should perhaps not blindly follow what the people before us did. Through scientific findings coloring our experience, we have found new truths. Beyond this, sociology and subjective experience has led to other moral findings. We have found that perhaps it is not wise to subjugate women, and we have good reason for it. We have developed concepts like the innate value of a human life. All of these are good and worthwhile. None of them are God given.  See, the problem with God, is people will then say: ‚ÄúThat person does not know God and speak for God, I do. You must follow me to truly follow God.‚Äù Or the quip: ‚ÄúGod reveals himself in mysterious ways.‚Äù It is so mysterious because there is no God and you are trying to read something into the universe that is not there.  It has come to the point that the only potentially convincing proofs of God are ones of logic. And they are not that convincing at all. Further, they cannot even hope to prove that God is personal and can communicate and reveal himself to people. They would only prove that the universe had to have some creating force. It is nonsense.  When you enter an argument and say you think your argument has merit, it is different than saying: ‚ÄúListen to me because I know God and God is on my side.‚Äù That person is being just as subjective as they accuse atheists to be.  We as humanity have created morals. There is no God. To claim divine right is an abomination. To hear Sharpton claim that right in an argument is blasphemous. That is the only word I can think to use. To come on the stage and purport to have some special knowledge and experience no one else has. That is sick. Utterly sick. He can delude and take advantage of people all he would like, but he should not say he has divine authority too. He is a huckster. Any priest or pastor or religious figure who claims to know the nature of God and claim that God has given them revelation and guidance is a fraud and huckster.  No one has gotten revelation from God. There is no God. Maybe they have had an epiphany, many they experienced something ecstatic and numinous, but that is not divine. It felt like divine revelation when I finally understood Statistics, but it was not. Everything just clicked and my brain entered a flow state. Everything clicked and Statistics became an automatic response, just as walking or breathing. Doing something by habit and out of consciousness is not God, it is just our brain being our brain.  You cannot talk with God and God cannot talk with you. There is no God. There is just this amazing sensory organ we have that has this emergent property of consciousness. It can lead to all sorts of perceptions and illusions, including the delusion of talking to God.  A suicide bomber does not have divine right, the South Carolina basketball coach does not have divine right, and Al Sharpton does not have divine right. They all have a delusion and misunderstanding of the experience they just had. Yes, what a statement for me to make, but it is a truthful one. There is no divine experience or authority. Just human experience.  We are much better off debating one another as humans with logic and proof or other forms of argument, rather than appeal to whoever is more in-tune with an imaginary God.",Yeah..,"&gt;To come on the stage and purport to have some special knowledge and experience no one else has.

I come from a Catholic background, born and raised.  Until recently I did not know the ‚Äú Reformed‚Äù movement existed as a movement distinct within Protestant Christianity.  As near as I can tell, you are not a denomination, but rather a philosophical/ theological movement found within several denominations: Presbyterian, Baptist, Dutch Reformed etc.   The ‚Äú Reformed‚Äù Faith seems to be the traditional faith of Switzerland, Holland and parts of Scotland.

What does it mean to be Reformed as opposed to regular born again or evangelical Christian?","Reformed is one of the Protestant streams that came out of the Reformation, with the other three being Lutheran, Anglican, and Anabaptist.  Most people would call us a denomination. It's just that different areas have given different names. For example, the Presbyterians are the descendants of the Reformed church of Scotland. The ""Reformed""  are the descendants of the Reformed churches of Continental Europe, mainly the Dutch Reformed, The Hungarian Reformed, The Huguenots (French Reformed) German Reformed, Swiss Reformed, and Waldensians (Italian Reformed).  Some Reformed are Evangelical, but not all are.  Some Reformed are Christian Right, but not all are.  Also, See the sidebar on what it means to be [reformed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/wiki/index#wiki_what_does_it_mean_to_be_reformed.3F).  Perhaps the biggest thing is that we hold to a high view of God's sovereignty, and to our depravity.  A lot of the confusion you have is because Baptists who hold to many of the Reformed tenets have co-opted the term. It's also kinda like how Evangelical which originally meant Lutheran was co-opted by the Religious Right, which makes the term complicated and confusing.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/Catholicism.jsonl,Catholicism.jsonl,pujnsv,The Theological Implications of people with Intersex Conditions,"So I was a recently thinking about religious people like me with ‚ÄúIntersex‚Äù conditions and how they could impact certain sacraments within Catholicism. Here are two hypothetical scenarios:  Scenario 1: There is a young devout male Catholic who enters seminary. He studies long and hard in order to be the best qualified priest he can be. After 4 years of study and after an additional year of serving as a transitional deacon, he is finally given the sacrament of Holy Orders and is ordained a priest. A couple of years later,let‚Äôs say about 5, he decides to take a DNA test or a chromosomal test and finds out that his chromosomes don‚Äôt match the sex he listed for himself and that he has a DSD(Disorder of Sexual Development). In this case, it could either be Estrogen Insensitivity Disorder or La Chapelle Syndrome. Either way, he is genetically a female but because of certain genetic mutations or issues in regard to the swapping of the chromosomes in the womb, he is born appearing phenotypically male. The Church teaches that God created male and female and that everyone is inherently one or the other. And we know that only actual males can be ordained a member of the clergy. Now my question to my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ is this: Since God and his Church only allow males to be priests, would the reception of the sacrament of Holy Orders, in this scenario, be valid, even though he is a biological female? Or would they be invalidated? If the answer is that the reception of the sacrament of Holy Orders for this individual is valid, then what would be your theological and philosophical explanation for its validity? Would God simply allow its validity due to his unawareness and ignorance of his condition and because he appears male regardless of his female sex? If the answer is no, it is not valid, then what about the Sacraments he administered, during the time that he thought he was a priest, such as the following: Baptisms, Communions, Confessions, Confirmations, Matrimonies, and Anointments of the Sick? Would the administration of these Sacraments be invalid like his reception of the sacrament of Holy Orders? Would all the people who have received these sacraments have to retake these sacraments by a legitimate priest? Or would God and his Church make an exception here? And for those answered my first question, I have another question for you. Once he finds out and is fully aware that he is actually a she genetically, would he have to stop acting as a priest and tell his superiors? (The answer to this question depends whether or not you answered yes or no to my first question) What if he was aware of his condition prior to entering seminary? Or finding out as a priest but taking it to the grave? What if he reached the status of bishop, archbishop, cardinal or even as the Pope while keeping his condition a secret? Would he be in mortal sin for doing so? Would we not have a valid Pope? Would his actions and decisions as Pope, whether ecclesiastical, liturgical or sacramental, be valid? Would his masses or canonizations be valid?      Scenario 2: In this scenario, there is a Catholic who appears female or male inside  and out and let‚Äôs say said Catholic gets married to their opposite sex spouse. The couple tries for a baby but to no avail. Each attempt is a fail. So they decide to go to a professional like an OBGYN to see if one is or if both of them  are struggling with infertility and said Catholic, like the priest in the first scenario, comes to find out that their legal and birth-determined sex doesn‚Äôt match with their chromosomes because of a DSD and that they are actually the same sex as their spouse, would their marriage be perceived as invalid in eyes of God and of the Church since both Catholics are inherently members of the same sex and because there is, for all intent and purposes, practically no chances of procreation? Would this union have to be annulled or would it be allowed by the Church regardless of the issues presented in the previous question above? And what would happen if there happened to be an ethical solution to the intersex Catholic‚Äôs infertility? Would the Church then have a reason to view this union as a real fruitful marriage even though, in reality, it‚Äôs inherently a same sex union? Or would the inherent same sex union aspect outweigh the fruitfulness and therefore be seen as invalid?","I don't believe that the Church has definitively stated that what she means by ""man"" is ""Person with XY chromosome"" and ""woman"" is ""person with XX chromosome."" I think there's reason to believe that it's not quite such a cut and dry definition, since the Church does teach that, for example, a person with Klinefelter Syndrome is not a third sex. If it is the case that what is relevant to the theological definition of man and woman is not perfectly dependent on the genetic sex of the person, then it's possible that the people in your scenarios actually ought to be thought of as the sex that everyone believed them to be, but with a genetic disorder that prevents them from procreating.   But even granting that, scenario 2 is less theologically problematic than scenario 1. An annulled marriage causes less ripple effects than a person invalidly performing sacraments. One might say that God would, through providence, prevent such a situation from occurring and prevent them from becoming a priest.","I have a background question based on your scenario 1.  Would someone who is born phenotypically male (I assume this means born with male genitalia, since those would be visible to the parents and doctors at birth), produce female sex hormones?  Do they have ovaries on the inside that are simply seldom scanned for because everyone assumes that they aren't there to be found?  For that matter, would such a person go through menopause?  I'm not 100% sure that the answers to these are theologically relevant, but they could be, and even if not, it's a worthwhile discussion and sparked my curiosity.  The ""simple"" answer is that we are created male and female *as a design* and the existence of LGBTQIA is simply random deviation from the design in the same way that we are meant to have two hands but some people are born with only one or zero.  But in this specific case, I'm not even all that familiar with the underlying science of exactly *how* intersex people deviate from the ""factory default"" settings.",comment_2,"Recognizes limitations in one‚Äôs own knowledge or beliefs,

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/ELINT.jsonl,ELINT.jsonl,2lry6g,Christian Hard Determinists: are there any established schools of Christian thought that are skeptical of the existence of an immortal soul?,"This is my first post here, so I apologize if the format is strange. My question is not really rigorous Ivory Tower stuff, it pertains to my own beliefs currently, so I'd love to hear from you theologians.   Some background on me:   * I was raised a non-denominational Protestant and accepted all of the doctrinally sound metaphysics of the Bible.  * However, my position on metaphysics changed after stumbling upon some philosophy concerning free will, causation, moral agency, and so on. I read a lot of different material from multiple sources, some philosophical, some neurological, and I became convinced that free will is truly an illusion; any given state in which the universe has been is simply the logical outcome of all previous states. For example, even though we perceive to make decisions on our own accord, they actually just boil down to chemical reactions and electrical impulses, which themselves were prompted by previous biological processes. I may not have explained this well, but it's not as pertinent to the question.  Like I said, though this did change my metaphysical position, it did not itself challenge my faith as a whole. If I'm correct, Calvinism is a good example of this Theological Hard Determinism, so the potential absence of free will in humans was not a threat to my Christian status.  However, I went even further down the rabbit hole, and am now convinced that not only is there no true free will, but there is no separate, immortal entity to which our bodies are attached. That is, we are a sum of our parts, from which consciousness arises, but exist only as a process that cannot continue when life does not continue.   A good summary of how I came to think like this is in this lecture:  http://www.ted.com/talks/julian_baggini_is_there_a_real_you  This was certainly not the *only* reason I now believe what I do, so even if it comes to light that the logic there is not totally sound, I will probably still need more convincing.   Therefore, I had to say: ""Welp... I guess I can't be a Christian anymore, because I don't believe in souls.""  This was not for lack of *wanting* to keep believing, but as a wise man once said: ""If you‚Äôre rational, you don‚Äôt get to believe whatever you want to believe. In other words, if you‚Äôre committed to rationality, then you‚Äôre putting your belief system at risk every day. Any day you might acquire more information, and then be forced to change your belief system. And it can be very unpleasant and emotionally disturbing.""  Therefore, I assumed I must renounce my faith, unless you can help me find a community of other Christians who are at least skeptical of the existence of the immortal soul, and may interpret biblical references to such very liberally, as metaphors or parables.   Thank you","Also, how would you respond to this?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_free_will#Omniscience_and_free_will","#####&amp;#009;  ######&amp;#009;  ####&amp;#009; Section 1. [**Omniscience and free will**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_free_will#Omniscience_and_free_will) of article  [**Argument from free will**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument%20from%20free%20will): [](#sfw)   ---  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;  &gt;Some arguments against God focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will). These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination).  &gt;[Moses Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Maimonides) formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:   &gt;‚Ä¶ ""Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [that] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.‚Ä¶""   &gt;Various means of reconciling God's [omniscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience) (possession of all possible knowledge) with human free will have been proposed:  &gt;   &gt;* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from [coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion), and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by [compatibilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism) philosophies.  &gt;* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent,  provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election).  The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.   &gt;* [Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaktivedanta_Swami_Prabhupada) has stated that man does have limited free will; he can decide whether or not to surrender to the will of Krishna. All other material happenings and their implications are inconceivably predestined.  &gt;   &gt;* [Molinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism) argues that God not only knows the singular outcomes of all our future free choices, but also knows what singular free choices would have eventuated in any possible circumstance. Truths of the latter sort are called ""counterfactuals of freedom,"" and God's knowledge thereof is referred to as his ""middle knowledge."" This view holds an Ockhamist conception of foreknowlege, in which there are singular truths about what inevitably happens in the future despite the plurality of future contingents which may and may not come to pass. Molinsts say that such foreknowlege can't determine such outcomes, because that's not the kind of thing foreknowledge can do.  &gt;* Compatablistic Calvinism re-defines a free act as one that is done in accordance with one's desires. While this view avoids incoherence, it is arguable that this is the kind of freedom Theists are concerned to reconcile with divine foreknowledge.  &gt;* Open Theism holds that future free decisions are known under the category of possibility, which is their true nature. The problem of freedom and foreknowledge therefore, is due to the traditional theologies of libertarian freedom positing gratuitous knowledge on God's part, which overextends God's settled knowledge to the realm of unsettled possibilities.  &gt;A proposition first offered by [Boethius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius)  and later by [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas)  and [C. S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis), suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book *[Mere Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_Christianity)*, Lewis argues that God is actually outside of time and therefore does not ""foresee"" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:  &gt;But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call ""tomorrow"" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call today."" All the days are ""Now"" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not. He does not ""foresee"" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way‚Äîbecause He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already ""Now"" for Him.   &gt;An obvious criticism of God being outside of time is that this does not seem to grant free will. [Predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination), regardless of how God perceives time, still seems to mean a person's actions will be [determined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism). A logical formulation of this criticism might go as follows:   &gt;   &gt;* God timelessly knows choice ""C"" that a human would claim to ""make freely"".  &gt;* If C is in the timeless realm, then it is now-necessary that C.  &gt;* If it is now-necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù). That is, there are no actual ""possibilities"" due to [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination).  &gt;* If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)  &gt;* Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.   &gt;   &gt;  ---  ^Interesting: [^Free ^will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) ^| [^Determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) ^| [^Dilemma ^of ^determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma_of_determinism) ^| [^Omniscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience)   ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+clxl7wi) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+clxl7wi)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.7216855669
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/TrueChristian.jsonl,TrueChristian.jsonl,3on02w,"Orthodoxy, Heterodoxy, and Heresy","&gt; *Orthodoxy.* The Greek original of our word ""orthodox"" means ""correct opinion."" In Christian theology it refers to the correct views on the essential truths of the Christian faith and the proper observance of central Christian practices. As a rule of thumb, orthodoxy is that which has been believed and practiced ""everywhere, always, and by all."" Orthodoxy thus means the right opinion about crucial doctrines and practices in keeping with what true Christians have always believed about these things...   &gt; *Heterodoxy.* We use the term ""heterodoxy"" to refer to different opinions. Heterodox teachings tend toward the margins of the received doctrines of the faith. Heterodox Christians still want to count themselves among the Christian tradition and still acknowledge the essential Christian truths. But they also want to be unique, innovative, and clever in their theology and practice. They feel comfortable recasting traditional truths in nontraditional language. They sometimes wan to rearrange, reinvent, reinvigorate, and reformulate the things that have been handed down to them. They like to surf the waves of the margins, buck the system, and go against the grain.  &gt; For example, some evangelicals who uphold classic orthodoxy have exchanged Sunday morning worship for ""seventh-day"" Sabbath observance. Their study of Scripture apart form its historical early church context has led them to believe that true Christians must keep the Sabbath (and often other Jewish feast days). The truth is, unbiased church historians know that since the days of the apostles themselves, Christians have been worshiping on the *first* day of the week - Sunday - in contrast commemoration of Christ's resurrection, and that the observance of ""Sabbath"" worship and the celebration of special Jewish festivals were never universal practices of the Gentile coverts to Christianity. The historical records from the first and second centuries are quite clear on this. Thus, the opinions of these modern-day ""Sabbatarians"" are ""heterodox"" - deviating significantly from what was originally practiced by the apostolic churches. Yet their minority opinion is still within the bounds of orthodoxy, because it does not flatly contradict an essential doctrinal or practical core of the Christian faith...  &gt; *Heresy.* The term ""heresy"" describes the conscious, willful, and stubborn departure from the central core of Christian orthodoxy. As such, heresy alone is ""damnable doctrine."" Heretics by classic definition are false Christians. Though most heresy begins as a radicalized heterodoxy, not all heterodoxy ends up in heresy. Heresy differs from heterodoxy in that the heretic *consciously* (not ignorantly), *willfully* (not accidentally), and *stubbornly* (not momentarily) denies a key tenet or tenets of orthodox Christianity. He or she consciously rejects certain truths that have been believed everywhere, always, and by all.  &gt; For example, somebody who denies the full deity and humanity of Christ is a heretic. The belief that Jesus of Nazareth did not literally rise bodily form the dead is heretical, And the view that the Holy Spirit is a created being and not a fully divine person is heresy. In other words, ""heresy"" is simply the direct denial of the core content of ""orthodoxy.""  From *Retro-Christianity: Reclaiming the Forgotten Faith* by Michael J. Svigel","I do not believe in the heterodoxy/heresy distinction. There is theologoumenon, which is pious opinion that is not doctrine nor contradicts doctrine or dogma. But that's not heterodoxy. I think anything contrary to what the Church teaches, that is, anything that is not Orthodox, is heresy.  I do, however, make a heterodox/heretic distinction. Both are people that believe in heresy, but the heterodox was born into it and may not even be aware of Orthodoxy, whereas the heretic was born Orthodox or converted to Orthodoxy and then taught or followed a position contrary to the Church (heresy) while proclaiming it to be Christianity (if it's not supposed to be Christianity they're an apostate). Under this definition, most Protestants/Catholics would be Heterodox, whereas Benny Hinn (who was born Orthodox) would be a heretic.  I mean, the Church has some sort of distinction about heresies. People baptized in the trinity can be married to Orthodox or received into the Church by chrismation whereas non-Trinitarians are not eligible for those things. But we wouldn't say non-Orthodox trinitarian denominations aren't heretical. They're just granted Oikonomia, as were certain groups in the 6th century I think it was.","I'd heard it explained that other denominations were ""heterodox"" meaning that we don't agree on whatever points of doctrine, but that they're still Christian because those differences don't impact the essentials of faith. Heretics are groups like Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses because they still claim to be Christian, yet their teachings do impact those essentials of faith by distorting things like the nature of Christ and salvation and so forth. But other religions like Muslims or Hindus, while they are false, are not heretics because they do not claim to be Christian.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.7159878491
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/Judaism.jsonl,Judaism.jsonl,2zyf1j,Sharing my first experience at a Jewish Shabbat service this past Friday night,"Sorry this is so long!  I hope you don't mind me sharing my first experience going to any type of Jewish service this past Friday night.   So, to start, I'm not very good in social situations. Social anxiety and all that. I know I'm not alone, especially when it's something that is really different and new. This was really different and new and, despite as much reading as I could do, I didn't know what to expect. What I did know is that it was a Reform Temple and that it would be more ""relaxed"" than a Conservative or Orthodox service.  I emailed the Rabbi ahead of time. I figured I should be sure it was cool if I went. I come from a Catholic background. Non-Catholics can go to service but there are certain things they can't do. Was Reform Judaism the same way? I dunno. Better make sure with an email to the Rabbi. He said it was cool and that there was a bar mitzvah thing going on.  Sweet!    So I get there a little early, wait in my car until 15 minutes before the service, because I'm supposed to find the Rabbi and he's going to have me sit with somebody.   I'm walking up to the doors and a elderly woman comes up to me and says ""hey hey.. Go help her!"" she has a very concerned look on her face. I turn and look and a woman had fallen out of her wheelchair and was on the road.   I go over to help. We're going to lift her into her wheelchair. First attempt doesn't work but the second does.   Social Anxiety level is at code red. Sweaty palms. Breathe in and out.  Ok, now to go inside. I find the Rabbi. He asks a guy to help me out. Sweet.  We're walking into the sancuary and the boy whos having the bar mitzvah hads me the book (I forget what it's called though it was explained to me!) and says ""Shabbat Shalom"", I said it back to him, and it felt weird. I don't think anybody could have known I wasn't Jewish or that I had never been to a service before but I definitely felt like an outsider when I said ""Shabbat Shalom"".  I'm not entirely sure why. It just felt weird.  But I have to get over that! Lets see what this is like!  We sit down and have a little conversation with my helper (which, I must say, was amazingly awesome! It did help so much to have someone explain what was going on. It was like having footnotes to the service).    There is a lot of Hebrew. I had heard that Reform services either use a lot less Hebrew or have shorter prayers/services. I'm used to Christian church services that are all in English. Even this amount of Hebrew was a lot. I liked it. Even for me, who doesn't have a connection to Judaism, felt a connection to their past because of the Hebrew.   So the service went by. Everybody went out and ate some food and hung out. The Rabbi was back in the sanctuary with a group of children answering their questions about Judaism. These were children who were friends with the boy whos having the bar mitzvah. Ok, I'm over twice as old as all of them but I could probably learn some things. It was cool because he showed us the Torah scrolls.  So it's been a couple of days. I didn't go to any of the events Saturday or Sunday. I figure I want to take it slow. I'll probably go next week. I'm completely fascinated. I have so much more to learn. Who knows if I'll ever convert. I don't want to think about that. I want to learn. If it doesn't work out for me, at least I'll have a knew knowledge of the history, culture, and religious aspect of Judaism.","Cool :)  I recommend going to a non- Bar Mitzvah service, it will be a very different experience!","Reform services are good for beginners to put their toes in the water, but if you want a bit of education with some (okay, a lot of) alcohol and great food you should see if there is a Chabad house in your area.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.4968407244

Groups that make bad decisions die off, whereas groups that make good decisions survive. What happens when the entire planet becomes part of the same group, and the group makes a bad decision?","Do you mean like now, even though it's not one society, global warming is about to wreck havoc across the entire planet, where muliti-millions will die as weather pattern shift and farming is in total  upheaval and the oceans have 80% less life in them than a mere 400 years ago from crass commercialism?   Well, with one society which has real and honest value system where the planet over all is considered a true gift from God and we are required to tend to everything very careful with compassion and respect, I think the world following Baha'u'llah could seriously be an immense move towards honest and not fake justice as today.","In most respects, there is only one group. It is one planet and we are in it together. If one nation plays with nuclear fire-crackers, we all -- and our grandchildren - glow in the dark. So it is a new situation (compared to 500 years ago) that has new choices and problems.  Nations, democratic or otherwise, are quite prone to making bad decisions when they are enchanted by demagogues. But the planet as a whole does not suffer that, at least for the present. Playing the cards of race or nationalism is not going to get you a lot of support on a global level. Nations also are prone to bad decisions by not making the necessary decisions. Climate change is an example. If the decision was taken on a global level (rather than an inter-nation level), procrastination may be less common. One of the reasons that nations put off making tough decisions is the ""can't someone else do it?"" phenomenon. (Cue the Simpsons, taking out the trash). The global ""We"" are not going to procrastinate  in the hope that the Martians will do the hard lifting for us.  But its a good question. Because there is no longer multiple parallel options for the human race, the consequences if we mess it up are ineluctable.

Thanks!","Miaphysitism unites the two natures of Christ in one person without altering or demeaning them.  Monophysitism says that at the incarnation the divine nature either combined with (and overwhelmed almost entirely) the human nature of Christ, or that it basically just replaced the human nature.  Miaphysitism is much more in line with Chalcedon, although to be honest, it's all a big confusing ball of nuanced jibberish at some point. Historically, folks who have been slightly further to one side of the issue (separation, say) have condemned similar (though less pronounced) views as being the opposition (unity, say). So if you look at Nestorius, he held that the two natures were distinct yet linked inseparably in Christ. He was condemned as a heretic, but one tradition says during his exile that he affirmed the ""orthodox"" decision as being what he was trying to say all along.  Much like the Trinity, we used terms to name it, but the way those terms apply in other areas of life don't work. One God, three persons? We have no way of picturing that. The incarnation is a mystery similar to the Trinity. And just as it would be wrong to say ""The Trinity is like the three-headed beast Cerberus"", it would be wrong to say ""Jesus is like if you had two people inside you pulling the strings"" or something. So people get themselves into trouble while trying to explain the incarnation.","Myaphisism says that Christ has one nature, both human and divine.   Monophysism generally holds that either the human or the divine nature of Jesus (more often the divine) has imposed on the other.

Are we obligated to have a large family? Must sex always be procreative?,"This is perhaps the hardest teaching for me to wrap my head around.  I recognize that the Fathers taught against contraception and that the Church has always taught against it. I'm not pretending to know more or better than the Church. I understand that contraception is typically used in extra-marital circumstances and perpetuates a culture of using and abusing others, but I struggle to understand why the use of it in a dedicated, respectful marriage is not allowed. For the record, we do not practice such methods.  I just need help understanding this  1.) Issue 1: Are we supposed to have large families?  If I have the financial means, are we supposed to raise a family of 5? 10?  What if we believe that we can provide our children with the best possible academic and spiritual guidance if there are only 2 or 3?  What about people who don't have the financial means?  What about a working mom who can't have tons of kids and maintain a working career?  My understanding is that NFP - even when practiced perfectly still had a 1% failure rate in a given year, and typical use has up to a 25% failure rate in a given year, so I have to imagine we would have more than 2 kids if we practice NFP  2.) Issue 2: Christianity tends to be about intent and what's in one's heart. If the desire of NFP is to have sex without producing a child, then how is the intent of that any different than the intent of the pill or barrier methods?  If the sex act is to be procreative, you are actively trying not to be procreative. It's using modern medical knowledge to purposefully avoid conception and doesn't seem ""open"" to life at all. If anything, it seems like NFP should be likewise condemned. To me, that seems like a questionable loophole much like how legitimate marriages are ""annulled"" as a loophole for divorce.  3.) I understand the Orthodox practice economia where they sometimes permit contraception due to circumstances. What if a woman is prescribed ""the pill"" for reasons other than contraception?  What about a woman who has severe mental illness or genetic carrier of horrible diseases and doesn't want to pass it on to children?  What about the medical risks of older mothers?    I'm just trying to wrap my head around all of this. Thank you","Then don't have sex. It's very simple. The sex was made for man, not man for the sex.  &gt;One  of the wise and awful truths which this brown-paper art reveals,   is  this, that white is a color.  It is not a mere absence of color;  it  is a  shining and affirmative thing, as fierce as red, as definite  as  black.   When, so to speak, your pencil grows red-hot, it draws  roses;  when it  grows white-hot, it draws stars. And one of the two or  three  defiant  verities of the best religious morality, of real  Christianity,  for  example, is exactly this same thing; the chief  assertion of  religious  morality is that white is a color.  Virtue is  not the absence  of vices  or the avoidance of moral dangers; virtue is a  vivid and  separate thing,  like pain or a particular smell. Mercy does  not mean  not being cruel or  sparing people revenge or punishment; it  means a  plain and positive  thing like the sun, which one has either  seen or not  seen.

First off I want to apologize for my formatting, I‚Äôm writing this through voice-to-text from my phone. I have been attending orthodox church with my wife and her family for the past two Sundays and have been considering taking catechumen classes. I grew up in a protestant household and while I did not attend church in my teenage years most of my moral compass and beliefs are strongly rooted in Protestant Christianity. As my wife was raised orthodox and that is the church that I‚Äôve been attending most recently, and we have a baby on the way, I feel a pull to renew my faith in Christ and join the church again. I do have a few hangups on joining the Orthodox Church however. I know the common answer to questions like this is to speak to a priest or the church‚Äôs father, but I was hoping for a little bit more insight from the people who are involved in the church and believe it‚Äôs teachings.  First, I was taught growing up that it is not right to pray to anybody except God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. praying to saints and Mary seems to toe the line on worshiping them. It makes me uncomfortable as I do not feel it‚Äôs appropriate to pray to anybody except God. I was speaking to my father-in-law about this (who is also not yet confirmed in the orthodox church) and he told me that in the roots of the orthodox church and the people who followed it, family and the extended family is much more present. Whereas in Western culture there‚Äôs not as much emphasis on our past, where we have come from, and who our ancestors were, the original orthodox followers were much more tied to their ancestors, who in this case would be some of the founding members of the orthodox church. So they are not so much praying to them, but talking to their ancestors and the people who have literally walked the same pants as them and lived in the same areas. this makes sense to me and it makes me feel like my uncomfortableness with praying to Saint or the mother Mary it‚Äôs more of a cultural difference as opposed to a religious difference. Even so it still makes me uncomfortable.  The second issue I have stems more from my wife and her belief in the Orthodox Church. When we talk about church she has more interest in just attending the liturgy instead of the sermon. I find that the sermon is the more important part of the church service as you‚Äôre attempting to read and decipher what‚Äôs written in the Bible, and how you should live your life. I feel like the liturgical only makes sense if you understand the writings of the Bible and the significance and his history of the liturgy. My wife argues that she doesn‚Äôt always agree with the sermons that the church‚Äôs Father has. In my opinion if you do not agree with the sermon you should find another church who‚Äôs deciphering of the Bible you do agree with more. She does not want find another church and just attend the liturgy. I find that this is a problem, and it‚Äôs almost pointless and insincere to attend the liturgy without also understanding the importance of the sermon before it.

The four things I‚Äôm noticing more as I‚Äôve distanced myself from the church.","Personally, I‚Äôm surprised at how well the mormon church has done in light of their past doctrine and history. As I began to open my mind to teachings beyond the white-washed version the church produces, I was surprised to learn that the church of today is vastly different than the one started by Joseph Smith. TBM‚Äôs explanation for this is the idea of an ongoing restoration. Somewhat ironically, even that thought is relatively new to mormonism.  I now have a different opinion to explain the church's success. It has been my experience that many of the sunday school and EQ lessons I‚Äôve been involved with throughout my life has included conjecture, assumptions, ignorance, and complicated explanations. I feel these four things has allowed a good number of the church membership in the past to maintain a testimony of a complicated and IMO problematic religion.  I‚Äôve noticed how many members are willing to interpret the gospel to fit into an ever changing culture and society. For example, by-in large, the consensus I‚Äôve noticed about how members view the LGTBQ community is vastly different than those members just a short couple of years ago. Conjecture seems to allow for the drift in an eternal gospel of divine principles.  There are assumptions made about the validity of claims the church or its leaders make. There is an absolutism among TBM‚Äôs that gives a tremendous amount of grace and reverence to what the prophets, apostles or other leaders say and many times critical thinking is set aside under assumptions that the church‚Äôs leaders are simply honest, correct and guided by the influence of the Holy Ghost.  Many members I still encounter are under an umbrella of ignorance which I‚Äôm still struggling to get out from under. There is so much about church history and past doctrines which members simply don‚Äôt know about, or only have a passing understanding about.  I was once taught that the gospel was beautifully simple and simply beautiful. As I engage with current apologists more and more, I‚Äôm noticing that many of them are beginning to go down paths of complicated explanations which I get lost in and I usually come away with more questions when things wind down.","Hello!

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,15fv1n4,"Echoes of the Unknown: Science, Faith, and the ‚óá of an Afterlife","\## Introduction   The debate between faith and reason has been a longstanding tension in human history. For some, faith is seen as irrational, while others view it as a profound human expression. Yet, could there be a meeting place where faith and science resonate in harmony? In this blog post, we'll explore the echoes of possibility in the realms of Chaos Theory, Conscious Temporal Emergentism (CTE), consciousness, and time, and how these concepts might resonate with the age-old belief in an afterlife.   \## Chaos Theory: The Dance of Order and Complexity   Chaos Theory, a branch of mathematics dealing with systems that appear to be disordered or random but are governed by underlying patterns and deterministic laws, has taught us that even in seemingly simple systems, complexity can arise.   These systems exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, meaning that tiny changes in the beginning can lead to vastly different outcomes later on. Far from negating determinism, Chaos Theory expands our understanding of it, revealing a universe that is both ordered and complex.   \## Conscious Temporal Emergentism: A Fluid Dance with Time   CTE introduces the idea that consciousness and time are intertwined, each shaping and being shaped by the other. This dynamic understanding transcends traditional rigid views of reality, acknowledging a fluid and evolving relationship between mind and time.   In this paradigm, consciousness is not merely a product of physical processes but a fundamental aspect of reality. If consciousness is intertwined with time and evolving, might it not also transcend the simple boundaries of our physical existence?   \## Einstein, Maxwell, and the Universe's Symphony   The scientific community has long marveled at the deterministic elegance of Maxwell's equations and the relativistic beauty of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. These theories have shaped our understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum and space-time itself.   Yet, even within these deterministic frameworks, the echoes of chaos and complexity resonate. The deterministic paths of particles, stars, and galaxies interact in a complex dance, revealing a universe that is not merely a mechanistic entity but a dynamic and evolving tapestry.   \## The Afterlife: An Echo in the Dance?   The belief in an afterlife is central to many religious traditions. It speaks to our deepest hopes and fears and resonates with a profound human longing. But can this belief find support or resonance within the scientific frameworks we've explored?   The very unpredictability and complexity that arise from deterministic laws, the intertwining of consciousness and time, and the dynamic dance of existence suggest a reality that is not easily confined to birth and death.   The echoes of possibility that resonate within Chaos Theory, CTE, and our broader scientific understanding might offer a metaphorical space for contemplating the afterlife. Far from being merely irrational, faith in the afterlife may be seen as a response to the echoes of a deeper reality, a reality that transcends the empirical confines.   \## Conclusion: A Meeting Place for Faith and Science   The universe, in its richness and complexity, sings a song that resonates with both the heart of faith and the mind of science. The echoes of possibility that we find in Chaos Theory, CTE, and the grand symphony of existence hint at a reality that is both scientifically profound and spiritually resonant.   Those who have been called irrational for their faith can find comfort and hope in the dance of science and spirituality. The possibility of an afterlife is there in the echoes, a gentle reminder of our connection to a grand, mysterious, and beautiful universe.   Let us dance with those echoes, celebrating the wonder, the complexity, and the profound depth of our human experience. For in this dance, we find not a chasm between faith and reason but a bridge, a meeting place where the love of wisdom and the wisdom of love resonate in harmony. In this space, the rational and the faithful may find common ground, guided by the echoes of the unknown and the ever-present possibility of the eternal.   https://chat.openai.com/share/253de420-6bce-4923-9a6d-6a5804aa6795",Science is not inherently atheistic.

Why do we consider those of different skin color or place-of-origin a ""race"" (meaning humans)? Why does where we live or who we call ourselves or how we look make us feel the need to say we are ""different"" than anybody else? In technicalities: Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, etc. are no different except in skin color and/or country of origin or however else you want to put it. We still are all humans nonetheless and should treat each other like one no matter what. That's why I don't understand racism. We need to stop dividing ourselves and unify and call us the human race. Not ""African-American/Black"", Not ""Caucasian/White"", Not ""Hispanic/Latino"", Not anything of that. It's okay to call yourself black or white or whatever else, so long as you consider yourself a member of the human race and no other subdivision. Division is death.  EDIT: Thanks for your thoughts towards this. I love seeing the way how other people think on matters such as this","While I agree with your point, I was under the impression that our inclination to group ourselves with others who look and act like us, while also excluding anyone who is different from our group, is a natural human survival trait. At least, seeing it this way has helped me have more patience with the idea of racism, cliques, stereotypes, etc. Anyone know more about this, or can correct me?","&gt;  Division is death  But we love division.  We love patterns. We are all-star pattern seeking machines. We're not happy until everything is categorised, ordered, sorted and pigeon-holed. It reduces the mental load of trying to remember everything if we can use a kind of category shorthand.  All of mathematics is an exercise in finding patterns so that everything does not have to be built from first principles all the time: numbers, inner product spaces, vector spaces, metric spaces, topological spaces. If you can prove that something is an *inner product space*, then you can rely on the other properties in the hierarchy *for free*.  Most of physics is concerned with finding a simplified model that generates or explains the results of an experiment to a required degree of accuracy. The models are not reality themselves, they are just mathematical patterns that generate results that match (close enough) with experiment.  We used to have lists of chemicals and then we figured out the periodic table. We used to have zoos of subatomic particles until the standard model classified them (using symmetry patterns). We have genres for movies, books, tv shows. We classify cars by colour or marque or fuel or carrying capacity or engine size or cylinders. We classify stars by zodiac or (more recently) colour or mass or age or MKK or whatever.  Even things like Linnean classification or cladistics only exist because we have an incomplete history of organisms. If we had the bones of every individual between the ancient monkeys and modern primates (including us), then picking the point where we branched would be completely arbitrary. Every organism is the same species as its parents. Species classification only works because we are limited to discrete exemplars rather than a full lineage. It's a completely human invention.  If we can't distinguish by species or by ""race"" (like say, our parents), we group by *generation*; baby boomers, genX, genY, millennials etc. If we can't even do that (with our peers), we have jocks and nerds and goths and hipsters and so on.

Under what authority did they establish these traditions?","Tradition has absolutely no authority in the church. However, tradition is important because it helps us to see how people of the past have interpreted the Bible, which would weigh some on how we interpret the Bible.","Just a quick review of scripture on the subject...  In the Bible, ""Tradition"" [*paradosis*] means *handing something over* or *passing it along,* like the way a relay runner passes on the baton to the next runner. The Bible is certainly part of the tradition we received from the apostles.  In his first letter to the Corinthian church. Paul says ""[Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and **keep the traditions** just as I delivered them to you.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2011:2&amp;version=NKJV)"" And to the Thessalonioans he says, ""[Therefore, brethren, stand fast and **hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle**](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20thess%202:15&amp;version=NKJV)... [But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to **the tradition** which he received from us.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20thess%203:6&amp;version=NKJV)""  We don't have an English verb version of ""tradition"" but the Greek Bible does:  - [Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled[a] among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word **delivered** [*paredosan*] them to us,](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201:1-2&amp;version=NKJV)   - [For I received from the Lord that which I also **delivered** [*paredoka*] to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread...](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2011:23&amp;version=NKJV)   - [For I **delivered** [*paredoka*] to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:3-4&amp;version=NKJV)   - [And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, **commit** [*parathou*] these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Tim%202:2&amp;version=NKJV)    St. Luke explicitly tell us above that what he's about to relate in his Gospel is what he received by oral tradition. Paul repeatedly refers to the stories he was told and passed on, including traditions ""by word *or* epistle"" that explain his texts and prescribe conduct. Paul also explicitly commends believers who keep the tradition, and warns against those who reject it.  Paul and the other apostles planted churches and taught them all about Jewish-Christian prayer, fasting, worship, morality and life in Christ. It would be silly to suggest that in the process he never taught them anything that he didn't later write down in the few pages of epistles we have from him today.  [Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of (his) disciples that are not written in this book](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2020:30&amp;version=NKJV) ... [There are also many other things that Jesus did, but if these were to be described individually, I do not think the whole world would contain the books that would be written.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2021:25&amp;version=NKJV)  One *could* assert that none of the oral tradition the apostles taught remains to today. but I don't think anyone would suggest that the first Christians didn't read the OT scriptures, the epistles (and later on, the Gospels) in light of the oral teaching they'd received for decades from the apostles who taught them everything.   In fact the first- and second-century Christians who judged and approved the texts of our modern New Testament, judged these works by how closely they corresponded to the oral tradition.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.09796743938
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/pagan.jsonl,pagan.jsonl,ddrbki,Spiritual burnout,"Has anyone else had the experience of spiritual burnout?  Growing up I was raised Catholic, but as I went to college I was exposed to many religions (the small town I grew up in seemed to be 85% Catholic and the rest were minor Christian denominations, there may have been one Methodist church and some Greek Catholics but no real diversity). I had already started reading up on some other faiths in high school but only lightly, but I was becoming increasingly aware that there were ""other religions"" besides Christian, but did not really meet anyone who practiced them until college. So, at college, started practicing Wicca privately after meeting some others who did, and when I went home, found myself in the broom closet. For 4  years this went on, and when I got out, I moved out when I got my first job and lived an hour and a half a way from home, and got into a regular routine of of practicing what I wanted at home, but still in the broom closet. I did at that time practice Celtic Wicca, and worked w/Celtic deities. But at some point decided to blend my Catholicism and Wicca into a Christopagan format. I felt it was working for me, I could have all my saint/angel statues and ""stuff"" out and didn't have to put it all away when family visited, and I started to get more into the beliefs that a lot of the older saints were commandeered gods renamed anyway, and even began to honor those deities even though the statues had a Xtian face. My rituals were flat-out Wiccan format, though.  After doing this for years, I felt I had gotten signs that I was having a ""falling out"" with the saints (that they weren't as into being called other names and treated like other entities) and the timing was such that I had a ""friend"" who I had taken on as a student of sorts who had chosen the Greek pantheon as her pantheon. At that time, I was a bit jealous, and thought I wanted to choose the Greeks as well, and she suddenly changed pantheons, but I then decided to adopt the Greeks.  And I worked with them a while until I accidentally offended them, and another friend suggested I try Norse. I have heritage with Norse, but after trying Norse, I realized I really didn't jibe with the negative political vibes ""some"" of the Norse pagans in my area were displaying, and didn't want to be accidentally grouped in with them. Tried Celts again, and soon learned some members of my family had a ""thing"" against Celts (dyed my hair red, only to find this out afterward). Tried Slavic, where I also had heritage, same political problems, backed out. Tried Egyptian, but had a hangup about the desert (too different from my climate and Wheel, which I found important to honor the harsh Winter here).  I was getting tired of mainstream internet conversations about how to do or not do your paganism (there seem to be an awful lot of people ready to tell you how wrong you are doing things), so I started looking into more experimental forms of polytheism, like PIE (but soon learned a lot of these theories fuel Aryan nazi ideas, dropped that). I started to believe all gods were actually Tulpas (not the Tibetan/projected entity kind but the Philamon/Jung/Reddit kind) and tried to create my own pantheon, but kept tweaking and re-tweaking until the project got stuck in ""development hell"" due to my indecision problems and perfectionism. I think I made about 10 different pantheons and kept getting the feeling I was still missing something, but I was also afraid if I didn't keep trying, any magickal experiences I could have would forever be out of reach, somehow, because if I went through all the ""real"" pantheons and couldn't make my own, what else is left? I felt like I was grasping at straws...  &gt;‚ÄúSo after a hectic week of believing that war was peace, that good was bad, that the moon was made of blue cheese, and that God needed a lot of money sent to a certain box number, the Monk started to believe that 35 percent of all tables were hermaphrodites, and then broke down.‚Äù‚Äï **Douglas Adams,** [**Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1042123)  I sort of feel like I have crashed. I feel so disconnected from anything spiritual at this point, that all I can do is lament that  at several times in my life, I really did experience some magickal and holy things. But now I am starting to feel that the plug has been pulled. How do I plug the cord back in?","I would like to help, but to be honest, the best advice I could give you, is to wait and see what comes of all this. To me, it seems like you just need a break, plain and simple. You'ce cycle through several pantheons, and that's totally fine in my book. And if at the moment no deities call you, then maybe it would be for the best if you simply waited until the spiritual longing returned.","I feel sad about it though.

I offer to go one-on-one with any man from your army and you send this boy?  Who in the fuck do you think I am?  Do you know who I am and what I‚Äôve done?‚Äù  As he says this, he waves one of his massive arms in a sweeping gesture and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve killed monsters and men all across the world‚Ä¶‚Äù As he sweeps his arm, everywhere he sweeps has become what looks like a forest.  She peers into the scene without entering. Goliath is on one knee, looking at the ground.  A pack of rather large wolves are circling him.  He sees the leader and the rest of them as they make their presence known one at a time. The wolves are all larger than normal and amazing creatures, but the leader is clearly meant to be the leader.  This specimen has broad shoulders, huge paws and a set of perfectly aligned, razor-sharp teeth which he is flashing as he sizes Goliath up. Even against an adversary as big as the one he and his pack are about to take on, he‚Äôs approaching this hunt as though there was a baby fawn in their sights. The moon is out and the pack typically has the advantage with their excellent night vision.  All of them have dark colored fur which is also an advantage at night time because all that can really be seen of them are their reflective eyeballs with one exception: the leader. The leader‚Äôs black coat is so healthy and shiny it practically gives him the appearance of a ghost because it looks like it glows when even the smallest amount of moonlight is out; shimmering brightly off his jet-black fur. Unamused, Goliath stands up without drawing his sword and lunges towards the leader and is on top of him in an instant, swinging one of his huge fists at the wolf.  This blow knocks the wolf off his feet and the second blow slams down on the wolf‚Äôs head, killing it instantly. He gets down on all fours and growls.  The growl is so intimidating the pack, who have faced large prey before, leaves their fallen leader and retreats. Goliath stands, laughs and walks up to the dead wolf.  He picks it up and with one, quick motion, completely tears the head off and gently sets it down next to him. He then grabs the headless body by the hind legs into the air and enjoys a drink of fresh blood.  He gets slightly irritated when the blood stops running at a nice, drinkable pace, so with one hand firmly grasped on one of the hind legs, he places his other hand in front of it and begins to squeeze in a forward motion. He is squeezing the wolf carcass like someone would if they were trying to get the last bit of tooth paste out of a tooth paste tube. Watching some of the wolf‚Äôs inner organs and blood get funneled out the hole where the head used to be and hearing the sounds of bones being cracked is disgusting! She turns away, leaving him to enjoy his snack.  When he‚Äôs done with his drink he shakes it.  He shakes it and then peers inside it as though he‚Äôs missed something. He stretches the neck-hole open and with surgical precision, reaches inside the torso and within a matter of seconds he has what he was looking for: the heart.  Even though the wolf‚Äôs organ is no longer functioning, it‚Äôs still a healthy heart full of well-exercised, tight muscles so he has to spend quite a bit of time chewing to finish it off. Content with that course of his meal, he flings the flattened, blood-drained carcass through the woods like a chicken bone and prepares for dessert. He now turns his attention to the wolf head and pulls out a sharp knife.  With the heavy base of the knife, he delicately taps one time on the skull then peels the skull bone away from the brain like he was peeling a boiled egg. He smiles a bloody smile, looks at the brain in his hand and uses the tip of his blade to get a piece of skull bone away from it.  The piece of skull falls to the ground.  He inspects the treat in his palm for more bones and without finding any, he tosses it into his mouth.  A couple of chews through the soft, grey matter and it slides smoothly down the hatch. Meanwhile, the wolves have moved a safe distance away and are staring in his direction.  The leaderless pack has watched everything from the shadows and regrouped, contemplating a revenge attack. All thoughts of getting revenge though are squelched when Goliath cups his mouth with his hands and lets out an extremely loud wolf howl.  It was as though eating the wolf heart gave him some sort of mystical power to imitate his victim‚Äôs howl and for a couple of seconds, the couple of seconds he was howling, it looked as though his head had transformed into the head of the dead wolf. The pack notices the eerie resemblance in both the physical resemblance of their leader and the sound of his howl the giant has taken on and pause with their ears pricked and their heads cocked to the side in disbelief.  After the initial shock, they immediately retreat at full-speed.  As they fade away into the darkness, the scene returns to the battlefield‚Ä¶   David now has his slingshot loaded with a stone and is shouting something about God while running full-speed towards Goliath. Instinctively, the large warrior carrying Goliath‚Äôs shield hands it to him.  Goliath is furious and insulted.  He takes the shield and with one swing of it, he slices through the man‚Äôs ribcage almost tearing his torso in half.

David immediately unsheathes the giant‚Äôs sword and says to the semi-conscious Goliath, ‚ÄúThis kill is for God!‚Äù as he slices into the giant‚Äôs neck.  Four more heavy strikes in the same spot and the head is completely severed from the body. She stands beside him as he grabs the large head by its matted, bloody curls and drags it back towards the Israelite army.  Before he can get all the way back to the Israelite frontline, they have begun to shout and attack the opposing army which has already started to retreat. David and Ziva take a break in his tent.  He is excited and just keeps staring at the head.  That‚Äôs his trophy.  He is so busy trying to prop it up in his tent, he is unaware of the presence of a very official-looking, highly-decorated army officer who has been standing at the door of the tent observing David‚Äôs bizarre ritual in silence and disgust mixed with a little bit of awe.",1.

Judas hung himself over a cliff (yeah, he betrayed Jesus, but considering most of Jesus' message was forgiveness, He could have told someone that Judas was suicidal. Judas clearly felt bad for what he had done and could've repented). The apostle's could've been able to spread Christianity without having horrible lives. Jesus could've allowed them to get into the government and get it legalized (which would've led to a lot more converts and no deaths).

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/Talmud.jsonl,Talmud.jsonl,bcmt8t,Why Does the Talmud promote these things,"There are a lot of really weird things written in the Talmud For Example: And Reish Lakish says: A gentile who observed Shabbat is liable to receive the death penalty, as it is stated: ‚ÄúAnd day and night shall not cease‚Äù (Genesis 8:23), which literally means: And day and night they shall not rest. And the Master said (57a) that their prohibition is their death penalty, i.e., the punishment for any prohibition with regard to descendants of Noah is execution. Ravina says: If a descendant of Noah observes a day of rest on any day of the week, even one not set aside for religious worship, e.g., on a Monday, he is liable. And Rabbi Yo·∏•anan says: A gentile who engages in Torah study is liable to receive the death penalty; as it is stated: ‚ÄúMoses commanded us a law [torah], an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob‚Äù (Deuteronomy 33:4), indicating that it is an inheritance for us, and not for them. And Rabbi ·∏§anina says: One who slaps the cheek of a Jew is considered as though he slapped the cheek of the Divine Presence; as it is stated: ‚ÄúIt is a snare [mokesh] for a man to rashly say [yala]: Holy‚Äù (Proverbs 20:25). The verse is interpreted homiletically to mean: One who strikes [nokesh] a Jew is considered as though he hurt the cheek [lo‚Äôa] of the Holy One. Rabbi ·∏§anina says: A gentile who struck a Jew is liable to receive the death penalty, as it is stated when Moses saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew: ‚ÄúAnd he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand‚Äù (Exodus 2:12). Rav Huna says: A gentile is permitted to marry his daughter. And if you say, for what reason did Adam not marry his daughter? It was so that Cain would marry his sister, because it is stated: ‚ÄúThe world shall be built on kindness.‚Äù Rav ·∏§isda says: A Canaanite slave is permitted to marry his mother, and he is permitted to marry his daughter. This is because he has left the category of a gentile by immersing in a ritual bath for the purpose of becoming a slave to a Jew, and consequently all his previous family relationships are disregarded according to halakha But if so, let the tanna count this prohibition among the seven Noahide mitzvot. The Gemara explains: According to the one who says that the verse is referring to the Torah as an inheritance, this prohibition is included in the prohibition of robbery, as a gentile who studies Torah robs the Jewish people of it. The punishment of a gentile who studies Torah is like that of one who engages in intercourse with a betrothed young woman, which is execution by stoning. Why Does the Talmud promote these things? Why does it say that assaulting a jew is no different than assaulting God, why does it call for the execution of non-jews simply for observing the Shabbat or studying the Torah?","Too many questions to involve myself with. And there would be too many answers, most of which probably wouldn't satisfy your curiosity.  The various Halachot have to be approached for these things, but in their full context. And that ain't gonna happen on Reddit any time soon.  Yes the Ancient Rabbis had contradicted the Bible a few different times, but largely to teach a matter based on it's Opposite View as an approach for elimination. In the Talmud this often doesn't get explained beforehand.  Others will simply tell you that these examples are minor extractions from the ""Oral"" Torah, but they don't know what they're talking about because they follow it up with that tired excuse that you can't ""know"" it without years of study.

What is less hierarchical about it? Would anyone here be able to shed some light on it or point to a better explanation than the ones I have read?","I struggled with it, too. The [official comparison chart](http://www.pcusa.org/resource/comparison-chart-former-form-government-new-founda/) is hard to read. Also, lots of people see [hidden agendas](http://www.layman.org/news.aspx?article=28186) in it as well, so it is sometimes hard to trust all third party evaluations or comparisons.  When it was explained at our Presbytery meeting, one of the key elements was empowerment. The example I remember was about the kind of over-specification of committees and meetings at the Presbytery level which were required even when they didn't make sense for every Presbytery. For example, if you had to have a number of specific committees, but had few available members or difficultly getting a quorum, you'd spend most of the available time checking the box for meetings at the cost of other, perhaps more valuable kinds of service work.  The reduction of the specific requirements, coupled with a more open ended set of goals, would ostensibly allow Presbyteries to achieve the same ends with less pedantic meeting structures. The point of the change was to specify the important work to do, but not so much how to get it done.  I don't have any idea how well it is achieving those goals, but that was what I was told.","Simplified Version:  It's basically a reboot of the ""G"" section of the book of order. Year after year, the GA has been amending and reshaping a form of government that was put together in 1983 at reunion. The world has changed a lot since then, and so has the church. Every time a need for an exception rose in the Form of Government, an amendment was added. The result became a pretty complicated and tricky to navigate book of order, tricky enough that you have to take an exam on it to be ordained (and that exam wasn't all that easy).  Basically, a task force got together and looked at ways of starting over from scratch. For the most part, the NFOG does the same things the OFOG did, but with much softer language, and a little bit more breathing room.  For example: In the Old Form of Government, there was a prohibition on Associate Pastors moving up to the position of Senior Pastor in the same congregation. There was a way around this prohibition, but there were all kinds of hoops that had to be jumped through. Now with the NFOG, an associate pastor can become a senior pastor with a 75% vote of Presbytery (I think, I don't have a Book of Order with me).  Here is another: to be newly ordained, you used to have to have an installed position (in other words, you couldn't be ordained to a stated supply in a congregation... if you don't know what I mean by ""installed"" vs. ""supply"", let me know, I'll explain that too). As a result, many first time pastors have a hard time finding calls, because the smaller churches that would hire them can't afford installed pastors, but could afford stated supply pastors. The NFOG makes it much easier to get around that.  This is what the NFOG was aimed to do. There were some legitimate concerns about it: my presbytery, for example, voted it down. I think ultimately there are more good things about it than bad, and the bad will be improved upon as we move forward.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.2504132343

Emphasis as in the original, any errors are mine not the authors.  # TL;DR  Imagine an alarm clock. The alarm was set at the First Coming of Jesus Christ and will ring to signal the Second Coming. We can recognise a number of ideas about the clock:  1. mainstream churches are still waiting for the alarm to ring 2. Early Quakers heard the bell! 3. Quietist Quakers pressed the ""snooze"" button 4. Evangelical Quakers turned the hands back to before the alarm 5. Liberal Quakers gave the clock away  These groups may well differ less because the have theological or ecclesiological differences, as such, but because they have different ideas about where we are in time, from which those other differences emerge.  # God's Time and Human Time  from pp 148-149  >Running through what \[Peat and Gwyn\] have been saying is the idea of \[‚Ä¶\] two kinds of time, God's time and secular human (constructed) historical time: the mythic and the mundane; heaven and earth. In Eden the two were co-joined. Earth was in heaven, in God's realm, Adam and Eve living in God's time. ¬∂ At the fall, heaven and earth part. Humanity, flawed, become separated from God \[‚Ä¶\] Humanity lives in this state on the plane of the mundane, in historical time, on earth. T. Candy Jones claims that Fox has a clear view of history in terms of God's interaction with the world. Creation  was followed by the Fall and the reign of the law. The both, ministry, death, and resurrection of Christ marked the end of the old covenant. However, there was then a second fall, the fall of the church. Luther and Calvin had only achieved a partial reformation and it was in \[Fox's\] time when Christ had come to teach his people himself that the apostolic age had been restored.  &#x200B;  >\[Peat\] has argued that Paul claims that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, this intervention of God on earth, this bringing to earth of heaven, offers the potential and reality of human transformation \[‚Ä¶\] The Second Coming, Paul teaches, is contingent with this third (after the Fall and the First Coming) and the final intersection of God's time and human time. \[‚Ä¶\] Early Friends were saying that they were living in the time of this third intersection, that the 'endtime' was now unfolding. In other words, early Friends were living in a realistic\_ing\_ eschatology.  # Outward Forms  from pp 154-156  >The Quaker belief in operating outside historical time and within a Second Coming framework led to a total rejection of the outward: set-aside priests, places, sacraments (cf. 1 Cor 11:26) and times. \[‚Ä¶\] All time was equally sacramental. Quaker shops opened on Sundays (Ready 1988:97) and closed on Wednesdays for Meeting. ¬∂ Quakers protested against 'holy days (so-called)' (Braithwaite 1912:47) and the celebration of times and seasons. When John Luffe went to convert the Pope \[in 1658\] he told Alexander VII 'Every day is a sabbath wherein we can serve God; (\_ibid\_ 1912:424). The Pope asked if there was the nothing to be done 'for the remembrance sake of our Saviour's blessed ascension'. ""No, no,"" replied Luffe, ""I have Christ about me and in me, and therefore cannot choose but remember his continually"".   &#x200B;  >Other Christians, still waiting for the Second Coming, had instituted all kinds of outward forms to help humanity in its relationship with God \_in the meantime\_ \[‚Ä¶\] to gather and outwardly signify the waiting faithful, times and seasons to mark key events of the First Coming. \[‚Ä¶\] The final vision of humanity's relationship with God is not necessarily distinct \[from the Quaker one\] but the mainstream Christian emphasis on the continued wait is, a waiting which involves the church being structured in a particular way. \[‚Ä¶\] The Church is a foretaste of what it to come and is *only as it is until* the time of the Second Coming.    >   >\[‚Ä¶\] In the 1996 Papal encyclical *Ut Unum Sint*, the Pope talks about the Roman Catholic Church as a healthy adolescent, not quite yet mature. For Friends, 'adulthood' and the lack of the ned to wait had far reaching consequences on their ecclesiology. Paul tells the early Christians to break the bread until the Lord comes again. The Book of Common Prayer (1162) reflects this passage almost directly in its section on Holy Communion. \[Similarly Advent and Epiphany ‚Ä¶\] ¬∂ For Friends this expectation of future change was anachronistic. The Lord had come again and all these outward forms pointed backwards to the First Coming and the a period of waiting which was now over, rather than forwards to a new universally available transforming experience.  # The Alarm Clock  p158  >It is almost as if early Friends heard the corporate or global alarm clock of the Second Coming ringing. Over three centuries, the 'snooze' button has been pressed (Quietism); the clock then rewound so the hands were closer to the First Coming than the second (Evangelicalism); and perhaps the clock itself has even been chucked out (twentieth century Liberal Quakerism, in which People will wake up/find transformation in their own time!).  p. 167  >If the \[move away from a conception of Quakerism as a Second Coming movement amongst\] Quietist Friends of the eighteenth century pressed the snooze button, the move to Evangelicalism and programmed worship in the nineteenth century turned the hands on the alarm clock back explicitly to reach a point where the focus was clearly on the First Coming and the meantime.   pp. 170-171  >Modernist and Holiness Friends co-operated with other Christians, in either good works for the Modernist Friends or , or in revival meetings for the Holiness ones. From this period, a Christian identity has preceded a Quaker one \[for those Friends\], highlighting the way in which programmed Friends moved back along the timeline of God's plan for the world. The negotiation of Friends of all traditions onto the ecumenical map was only possible through the loss of the belief in the present Second Coming. The hands of the alarm clock were turned back.  &#x200B;  >\[‚Ä¶\] Within holiness theology, silence did not make sense when you could be praising the Lord or out saving souls. Other 'peculiarities', including the peace testimony, now belonged to apostate \[in the view of Holiness Friends\] groups of so-called Quakers and could not be considered part of an authentic Quakerism. In London Yearly Meeting in 1861, the inward Light was questioned as unscriptural (Isichei 1970:70) ‚Äì the notion of the inward and present Second Coming was lost on both sides of the Atlantic.  &#x200B;  >In Britain and in Liberal Quakerism generally, the Second Coming ecclesiology (the lack of mediated guidance and outward forms) would be retained by the liberal reinvention of Quaker theology at the end of the \[19th\] century would not bring back the Risen Christ into their theology. In the programmed elements of American Quakerism and elsewhere in the world, the Risen Christ would not be lost but became a future hope rather than a present reality.  p 178  >At the turn of the \[20th\] century the key Quakers in the Liberal Friends' reinvention of Quakerism claimed that Quakerism needed to be a faith relevant to its times; ever‚Äìopen to new Light under a fresh theology of continuing and progressive revelation; rooted in the authority of personal experience. \[‚Ä¶\] It is a short step from this combination of theological parameters to the possibility of diversity and, critically, a diversity which can include the non-Christian (and, in a secularised society, the non‚Äìtheist).   p. 182  >In the way they talk of their religious experience and in their diffidence about explicit religion, Liberal Friends appear to have lost the experience of the Second Coming. However, they have also chosen not to reform their structures. They chose instead the behavioural creed as a way of maintaining an explicit religiousness. In a way it makes sense. It safeguards the experience of God which is fundamental to that Friendly persuasion, and in its lack of explicit belief‚Äìtalk, it can defend itself agains the rationalist philosophers' attacks on the meaninglessness of religious concepts.   >   >In a sense all Christians are focussed on the Second Coming even if their emphasis is on the First. It is a question of experience and emphasis. What happened in this radical reinvention of Liberal Quakerism was that the way was opened for the Second Coming to become irrelevant.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;",Is there a topic for discussion here?,"Several, I'd have thought.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.1508917671

Sometimes the courses rotate with terms etc so best to keep an eye on current offerings but I'm sure Baha'i theology will be available soon.,"Strictly speaking, you'll be hard pressed to find intensive and in-depth courses on Bahai topics in a standard university setting. For anything more than introductory study, your best bet is to visit the Wilmette Instituted website where you can find an extensive range of college level recorded courses and lectures all freely available on YouTube. You may also enroll in courses (remotely), some of which may offer college credit. New courses are regularly offered and easy to get involved in. They're also of excellent quality!  Lazos Learning is another organization that offers a few in depth courses of study, best for those oriented to tying Bahai study with engagement in the activities (such as social action, community building) that Bahais undertake around the world.  The Association for Bahai Studies is another more advanced avenue for scholarly study, though it's increasingly focused on accessibility and raising a new generation of scholars, and making advanced Bahai study more open to all believers (as it should be, since we have no formal class of priests or scholars, and intellectual advancement of the faith depends upon each and every believer).

So it's been a while since I've posted meetups, but the groups have been going well. We're celebrating MECA's TWO YEAR birthday ([one of our first public events linky here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/5ncfmj/meca_midlands_uk_meetup_1_leicester_29th_jan_2017/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)).  For those who don't know, MECA started after (totally randomly) I met an exmoose with badass tattoos in Birmingham, we sad down and spoke about all stuff exmoose, [Lenny Henry](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/29/article-2547894-0073865B00000578-639_634x437.jpg) the came by our table and said Hi (I'm not kidding this legit happened), and we decided to set something ExMoose related up in the Midlands.   That was all the way back in 2015, and as you can see, groups take a LONG time and a lot of hard work. So many people have pitched together to make MECA work since 2015. Since starting we have had some of the most amazing people join up, a few of the admins in particular have been kicking ass getting events going.  For this event, we've actually hired a private room with a buffet so it'll be private but you'll get to mingle with each other.  The process to join is simple, get in touch with me and I'll vet you along with other admins. I've created some time specifically for this, but the other admins are much better as they are physically in the Midlands.  Remember, **everyone in this group has been and has to be vetted**.  If you're worried about safety, you're welcome to google me (Imtiaz Shams) and see that I'm definitely an Ex Muslim and not your great uncle Ifthekar.  These groups are NOT political, they are there to be a place where you can hang with other exmeese. But of course we do talk about politics, Islam, pets, Fifa, Sadiq Khan, the best types of cheese etc etc etc.  PM me, comment on here, etc etc etc!","Wow.

Me: that's really cool, anyway, I'm gonna head -   Ultra-Bitch: But then she had an aneurysm.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/DebateReligion.jsonl,DebateReligion.jsonl,7b8xte,A question for Thomists,"The universe is contingent. This means that it could have been other than it was. At some stage prior to the existence of our universe, there was a potentiality for our universe and a potentiality for some other.  God is a being of pure actuality, with no potentials. As such, God does not require actualization by a prior being. God is also the creator of the universe - God selected one of the potential universes and actualized it, giving rise to the one we live in.  So my question is: In what being did the potential for universes reside, prior to creation? This potential cannot be in God, because God is pure actuality with no potentials. It cannot be in the actual universe, because then it would be prior to itself. So there must be a being external to both God and the universe, with the potential to become a universe.  Without a being of this type, there is no potentiality for any contingent thing - and thus God cannot actualize one. Therefore, since the universe does exist, the being-of-potentiality must be uncreated and co-eternal with God.  What is the nature of this being?  (Note: above uses of the word ""prior"" mean metaphysically prior, not previous in time. ""Being"" also means a thing that is, not necessarily a conscious life form.)","&gt;God selected one of the potential universes and actualized it, giving rise to the one we live in.  Not a Thomist but I just wanted to point out that this is the only world God could have created. He didn't arbitrarily 'select' one option of the universe over another since he doesn't have a deliberative will. Being infinitely free and perfect, he could only do the most perfect action.","This only resolves my question if you take it to mean that the universe, and everything in it, are necessary, and there are no contingent things.

I read the Samgamavacara Jataka (https://suttacentral.net/ja182/en/rouse) and I can't quite understand what to learn from it. In the prior birth, the Buddha was an elephant trainer, and his half-brother Nanda was his elephant. They go to war and Nanda becomes terrified of the defensive weapons of the city, but the Bodhisatta exhorted the elephant to have courage, and he goes on to tear the city walls apart.  It seems like both the elephant would create terrible karma for such destruction, and the Bodhisatta would also, for encouraging the elephant, but there is no indication that either of them were anything but heroic.  Can anyone explain what's going on in this Jataka?

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/hinduism.jsonl,hinduism.jsonl,1s4gib,What happens after death? Reincarnation or heaven?,"Hindus generally believe in reincarnation. We believe in the atma being immortal and occupying temporary vessels in the material world.   However, in the Mahabharata, Arjuna goes to 'heaven' where he meets the gods, his forefathers and others. How is this possible? Should not they be reincarnated?  I thought a bit, and here is my take on it (This is with a heavy Vaishnava bias on it):   There are many *lokas* (heavenly realms) and *talas* hellish planes. Based upon your adherence to dharma in your previous life, you either are born in an upper plane, or lower realm. Many of the heroes and forefathers Arjuna (and also the Pandavas after they died) encountered in heaven(actually Indraloka)  were in fact reborn after they died. Due to leading virtuous lives, they were reborn into heavenly beings. Being more 'enlightened' as being heavenly beings they remember their past lives. (again this is another theory of mine: the higher in the plane you are born, the more enlightened you are about the universe, maya, etc. My example is that regular animals are not aware as much as humans are, and the same comparing a human to an deva). Being born on a heavenly planet makes you as mortal as being born anywhere else, you just live much longer. Thus, when the Pandavas died, due to following dharma and leaving extremely virtuous lives they were reborn as heavenly forms.   That goes to say this is the regular cycle of reincarnation, a soul's true objective is to escape this cycle and merge with the Brahman.   What are all of your thoughts on this? This is what I gleaned from reading religious texts. I am by no means an expert. How do my thoughts confer/differ from yours?","Heaven and hell for several millenia each depending on the things you've done in life. Once finished, rebirth. Sentencing lengths for common sins are defined in the Srimad Bhagavad.","This is all pretty standard in Vaishnava scripture. For standard Vaishnavism though, I've never encountered a text that says the ultimate goal and true objective of the soul is to ""merge with the Brahman."" But, yeah, the gist of it is that there is material heaven - which is temporary and karma-based - and there is transcendental heaven, which is eternal and based on one's relationship with the Absolute Truth.",comment_2,"Provides clarifying comments,

I mean, you can break a law, or obey a law, but how does ""fulfill"" work?","The law was never meant as something that *only* was to be kept or broken. Rather, it was also a typology that was pointing to Christ for Him to fulfill it. Primarily because man was never going to be good enough to keep it.  ‚ÄúSo then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith.‚Äù Gal. 3:24  Christ mentioned how He was called to fulfill that law.   ‚ÄúThen he said to them, ‚ÄòThese are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.‚Äô‚Äù  Everything in the law points to Christ. Here is an example of a law that is a shadow of Christ:  Leviticus 14:4-7  4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:  5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:  6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:  7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.  One bird was killed in an earthenware vessel and it‚Äôs blood was run over the live bird along with water to wash it. This is a picture of Christ dying and his blood cleansing the sinner. The live bird is then set free. A picture of the sinner being free from sin.  There‚Äôs a lot one could dissect in this passage. But it is just one piece of the whole law that testifies to Christ which Christ fulfilled.","It is a fine distinction.   God gave the commandments, we needs to obey. But, we need the strength to fulfill it.  Under the old covenant, man had to struggle to obey God's commandments. Now the Spirit of God is in us. He causes us to obey. In the past, God gave the commandments, and we supplied our own strength for their fulfillment.   Now the commanding One is God, but the supplying One becomes God also. After resurrection, Christ came into us to become our life. The result is that we are enabled to fulfill God's commandments. This is the gospel. Christ's sufficiency has become our ability.

I have asked him to go to counseling and back to church and he refuses. He says he will work on being better for me, but this never sticks and the same abuses happens over and over.  I will admit that I had been unfaithful at the beginning of our marriage after one night when he slapped me across the face. It was a moment of weakness on my part and I repented of my actions and have since remained faithful to my husband. My husband knew about the situation and had forgiven me.  Just recently I have learned that my husband has been unfaithful as well and it's another heartbreak for me on top of everything else.  I have prayed and prayed but feel so lost. I am unsure of what recourse I have spiritually. I know God hates divorce and that is not what I want but I don't know how much longer I can live like this. If I were to divorce I would want to find happiness with someone again, but I am unsure if that would even be rightfully possible in God's eyes. If it's not then I know I need to follow God's will but I'm unsure of what that would be anymore.","This is why I am for people living together before marriage. That's really awful though and I am so sorry you are going through this. You \*really\* need some secular support services the reason I say that is because you're going to get and probably already have got a lot of bad advice about sticking it out etc etc because God doesn't like divorce. The whole one-partner for life, no divorce allowed is a method of control. It in itself is an abusive framework. You cannot jeopardise your life, liberty and well-being because of misguided religious ideals. In my opinion you \*should\* be divorcing this man. He is an abuser. There is no excuse for slapping you even if you did do something 'unfaithful'. The man doesn't care about you, he cares about \*ownership\* of you. If God is love in your world view then love is what you should seek after, you will not find genuine love with a person who is willing to abuse you physically, emotionally, sexually and who demands faithfulness but is unwilling to respect you in that same way. I can guarantee that this experience is already having an affect on your mental well being and if you do not get \*proper\* support, it will deteriorate and you may end up in a state-of-mind that is incredibly disruptive and detrimental to your ongoing function. (ie. PTSD). I encourage you to seek out refuges for women, domestic violence services and talk about these things with them. His behaviour is criminal, you're worthy of love and respect. You do not have to tolerate that kind of behaviour. I hope you the best - I understand this is a huge decision and a complex situation, I am not under the illusion it'll be easy for you. But I trust that if you can connect with the right supports you'll make it.","We love you.  You can leave.  The bible explicitly allows for divorce in the case on infidelity.  He's broken his marriage vows completely.  Just because you had sex with someone else doesn't mean he didn't end the marriage of equals himself, first.  Yes, you sinned.  You have repented.  We love you.  We are praying for you, please let me know if we can help you in any way.  You need an external support system ASAP.  Your husband is not God, and he cannot define you.  Our Father calls you Daughter, no one can say anything otherwise.  Edit:  You may also remarry.  Jesus loved the woman at the well who married SEVEN TIMES! And when they met, she was living unmarried with her partner.  The first thing she asked Jesus when he revealed he knew this wasn't ""Who are you""?  She asked ""Where is the proper place to pray?"".  Such faith in the Lord!",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.6096905428

One cannot promote a culture of competition, unapologetic individualism, self-love and so-called ""self-empowerment"" and still expect fair unbiased justice to prevail. At the heart of every injustice is a man's decision to ""empower"" himself. And yet, our society loves to encourage this hedonistic mentality. To ""grab your slice"". To ""love yourself"". To ""build your financial legacy"". To ""empower yourself"". To ""do what *feels* right"". And then we're surprised that our leaders are dysfunctional. This is what we asked for.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/Quakers.jsonl,Quakers.jsonl,15am07g,How do Quakers view non-pacifists whose work helps bring an end to injustice?,"I understand that Quakers and many other peace churches are not passive and are very engaged in valuable social justice, humanitarian, and non-violent resistance efforts. However, others believe that harm and injustice cannot be stopped without the use of force or violence and act accordingly.  My question is, how do Quakers view these non-pacifists that are genuinely striving to achieve the same ends as pacifists (justice, freedom, peace)? For example, Quakers working to end gun violence long-term but a non-Quaker using violence to stop a mass shooter in the moment, or Quakers aiding Jews during the Holocaust but Allied soldiers liberating the concentration camps to end the genocide. In other words, the ends pacifists seek are greatly aided by the violence of non-pacifists without the pacifists violating their convictions.  Are these disagreements seen as more of how one chooses to fight based on individual conscience (respecting others‚Äô tactics even if you don‚Äôt agree), or as ethically unacceptable and immoral for everyone?","That honestly depends on the individual Quaker, some approve, others don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a matter of circumstance and a matter of person.","I‚Äôm afraid the answer is going to vary from Quaker to Quaker. Our testimony to peace and history of non-violence is not a rule or creed but a value.  You will find almost every viewpoint on this topic among Quakers, from ‚Äúviolence is never justified‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs not how I would do it but I respect it‚Äù to ‚Äúviolence can be justified‚Äù.  That‚Äôs not a very satisfactory answer, I‚Äôm aware. Quakers tend to talk about things like ‚Äúletting your life speak‚Äù and being guided by the spirit when tough issues like this arise. It might be worth seeking out some writings by Quakers on the topic of peace and non-violence. My starting point might be Britain Yearly Meeting‚Äôs Quaker Faith and Practice, or one of the Quaker Quicks books on pacifism, but I‚Äôm aware both these recommendations are UK-centric.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.8767238821

How have people misunderstood you or your religion? What did they assume and what is the correct view?   I love anecdotes, so if you have interesting ones, please share.","I practice Vaishnavism. There are *so many assumptions* people make. Here are two biggies:  **1) Hinduism is a single religion.** Incorrect. Hinduism is actually very diverse. It's more diverse than the Abrahamic religions. It includes at least four very different conceptions of God, and at least two very different conceptions of the nature of the soul. These religions are culturally related, and share some fundamental conceptions (like reincarnation), but they are *distinct religions*.  **2) Hindu religions are polytheistic**: Incorrect. My tradition is explicitly monotheistic, and it is one of the most widely practiced Hindu religions. The Hindu texts use at least three words that are often all translated into English as ""god"" by laypeople. (a) *""deva""* means demigod. In Vaishnavism, these are mortal beings who possess none of the classical characteristics of God (neither omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, nor omnibenevolent) and they worship God. They are not to be worshiped as God, although it's fine to be appreciative of them like you would be appreciative of any very capable and talented individual. (b) *""brahman""* is the impersonal manifestation of God as energy and light. (c) *""bhagavan*"" is the personal manifestation of God as a loving individual with who we each have an eternal relationship.  (b) and (c) are both aspects of God. They both possess the classic God qualities listed above. In Vaishnavism, (c) is considered to be the more complete understanding of divinity, and it encompasses (b). In another Hindu religion, that is the other way around.","This is so right on. I studied religion in undergrad and what you've written lines up exactly with my understanding. I'm not Hindu, but I can imagine that Hindus that interact with Westerners run into this stuff *all the time*.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_active/TrueChristian.jsonl,TrueChristian.jsonl,gqxcwe,"Ceasing Sin, Taming the Mind, Subduing Emotions","The greatest reassurance in this life is that God forgives. All throughout scripture, He has recorded his mercy, grace, and long suffering patience. He gave humanity His law, and pursued us even when we rebelled against Him. He is so forgiving despite constant betrayal. He loves so greatly, and shows us in the saddening love stories told in the book of Hosea and Song of Solomon. He will always be there. For this, I am so grateful.   Because of this great love and patience, our character, my character, must grow. The spiritual life is one of progress. Sin must cease. The mind must be tamed. Emotions, subdued. While this seems like a lot to deal with all at once, it is more manageable when focus is shifted to a singular point. Tackling all of these simultaneously is possible, but even approaching one of these issues in the development of character can be daunting.   After all, breaking away from a well worn sin seems formidable, most especially if all one thinks about is the wrong doing. In fact, focusing on an unwanted sin presents two problems. One, the act of focusing on sin moves it to the forefront of the mind. If this is what is being thought about most, all sorts of possibilities and opportunities to sin will be brought to ones attention. The second problem that is presented is that the lesser goal of behavior management becomes the desired objective. The end of sin ultimately goes beyond modifying behavior. Additionally, while sin could be reduced to poor behavior, it is difficult to always view it this way. This can get particularly blurry when it comes to private sin that are kept in the inner life. It can be easy to pardon oneself of sin that no one else knows about. The Lord knows, though. Ultimately, focusing only on what one shouldn't do makes behavior modification difficult, and behavior modification is not the true goal in the quest of holiness and ridding oneself of sin.   Conquering sin is challenging enough. I've highlighted some ways that it can be challenging already. So, how is one to tame the mind while working on this issue? Racing thoughts. Sluggishness. Natural limits. All of these things seem to predetermine how each individual can address their mind and thought life. Thankfully, there is wonderful news. The same method for dealing with sin can be used to tame the mind. And, due to the amazing nature of the human brain, everyone is guaranteed to experience success in through implementing this method of character growth in the spiritual life. Some will simply need more time. This is due to neuroplasticity, an innate and uncontrolled attribute of the human brain. The brain will learn and change if the conditions are present. Which, it would so happen, they always are as long as stimulus is present. Fortunately, the guaranteed way of addressing sin in ones life come also takes on the mind by carving out a new form of thought. Breaking free from the path of least resistance without any strenuous effort on an individual, though some discipline may be required.   Surely, though, subduing emotions requires more? Yes and no. Well fed patterns of anxiety may manifest out of one immediate control. Yet, with time, these too can shift as the mind is tamed. What is important, though, is for one to remember that an individual is not their emotions John is not anger, he is angry. Jane is not the embodiment of happiness, she feels happy. If this is committed to memory, than discouragement is less likely to overcome a person while employing a singular method of removing sin, taming the mind, and subduing emotions. Discouragement is an emotional state that makes progress seem elusive. It must be subdued.   What is the singular method of dealing with these three areas of character growth in the spiritual life? It is addressed throughout scripture and taught by Christ. It is simple and time consuming. It is challenging, yet attainable. My personal favorite way that Jesus taught on this is as follows. It should be noted that the apostle Paul expounds upon much of what Christ taught concisely in two separate letters to the early church. I will summarize here, both my favorite way that Jesus taught on character growth and excerpts from Paul's letters on the matter:   John Chapter 5; Verses 6, 8, and 14: When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, He said to him, ‚ÄúDo you want to be healed?‚Äù. . .Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúGet up, take up your bed, and walk.‚Äù. . .Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, ‚ÄúSee, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.‚Äù   Galatians Chapter 5; Verse 16: But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.   Romans Chapter 8; Verses 1-2, and 5-6: There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. . . For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.   The singular method to address sin, the mind, and emotions in the development of character is to run headlong towards God. Pouring over His word and having it seep into the mind will yield the results that so many are striving after. Write it on your heart, and if that proves to be impractical, then write His word on your notebook, your desk, your walls. Give God the same attention that is given to a favorite celebrity, T.V. show, or sin. What ever it is that you desire most, even knowledge of God, count it all as lost, and simply spend time in His word and with Him in prayer. Not in church, though I would encourage people to go or stay involved. Not reading about God and learning from scholars, though it certainly can paint a clearer picture of what was happening historically. Certainly don't read books on theology before simply pouring over the word of God and spending time in prayer.   God tells us in His Word that we will not gratify the desires of the flesh if we walk by the Spirit. We are also warned that setting the mind on the flesh will bring death, and by walking in the flesh, or acting on the desire of our bodies and minds, our minds will be set, or continue to be set, on fleshly/worldly things that are either sinful directly, or become idols.   What is also great news is that all who follow are free! Sin know longer owns you. ""See, you are well!"" What then of the individual who still desires to continue in the things they did before Christ became the one they called Master? They should not be discouraged. Emotions can not be allowed to be a ruling force in life. Again, ""walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."" The existence of a desire is not who a person is. You are free. All who follow (active verb) Christ are. Walk in the Spirit and you will not gratify the sin that is dangle before you. Pour all your focus on God. Recall, I stated that this singular method is time consuming. This is inevitable of anything that is loved. Pour all your focus on God. Not on your desire. Nor on your desire to do right. Simply on God. After all, if there is any interest in turning to the Lord, that shows there are tow desires present.   Galatians Chapter 5; Verse 17: For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.   Take heart! The desire for sin may be present, but so is the desire for God! Be free and not discouraged by guilt, shame, or even a desire for wickedness. Instead, pick up your mat, your sin and shame, and walk towards God. Go to Him, and sin no more. If you fall, get up. Don't ever put your focus on sin again. Do not keep track of sin. Do not entertain sin. Do not excuse sin. Do not think about sin. Don't focus on sin. Instead, put your mind on God. Accept that He made a way for you. He found you, loves you, and has taken care of sin for you. You are free, your debts are paid! So, now, follow Him! Rest in Him, and experience joy in Him.   Romans Chapter 12; Verse 2:  Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.   Let your mind be renewed. Whatever is on the mind most, that is what is loved most. Set yourself to look upon God. Everything else will follow. There are no shortcuts. No way around this. Seek Him, and only Him. No knowledge about Him. Not those who follow Him. Just God. Who is the One at the center of so many debates, questions, and topics? Seek Him. Who is the One that people want to stop sinning for? Seek Him? Who is the one that people learn so much about? Seek Him.  I will close with one last note of encouragement. All of this is available to all. No matter the struggle, no matter the sin, not matter the background. It does not even matter the present consequences of ones actions. God has conquered sin, and set you free. ""See, you are well!"" Whatever the struggle, keep going and shift your focus on God completely. For some, it simply takes time. Do not worry about others. Be encouraged and go to God. Spend time with Him.   Psalm Chapter 96; Verse 2: Sing to the Lord, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day.   Psalm Chapter 98: Oh sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him. The Lord has made known his salvation; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations. He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth; break forth into joyous song and sing praises! Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody! With trumpets and the sound of the horn make a joyful noise before the King, the Lord! Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; the world and those who dwell in it! Let the rivers clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.","Threads and posts from new accounts are removed automatically.

I think it's important to have the other side of a news story/idea but every leftist news outlet/yt channel I know of are just pure propaganda.,"John Oliver‚Äôs an easy one, the jokes can be cheesy but he also covers why issues are important pretty comprehensively.","The ‚Äúother side‚Äù is always going to seem like propaganda regardless of which ‚Äúside‚Äù you are on as you will view it much more critically. I‚Äôd suggest watching your regular channels with a critical eye, and seeing if you can find the merit in the reports or news sources that don‚Äôt align with your own outlook.   Also, drop the ‚Äúleftist‚Äù language. Polarising politics is the opposite of free-thought.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.1860757816
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/Quakers.jsonl,Quakers.jsonl,idmt91,New to Quakerism,"Hello, all.  I've just recently stumbled upon Quakerism as a religious movement online. I had heard of them before but only ever knew them as something akin to the Amish (i.e. an outdated, technology-shunning and insular community unavailable to outsiders). I've obviously since figured out that this couldn't be further from the truth. I was raised an Evangelical and have been quietly agnostic for about the past 5 years or so (I'm 20). I've always had an interest in other religions, and I've found aspects of Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and more that I like and feel a calling towards, but the Christian framework and the Bible have always seemed to keep a hold on me. I struggled to reconcile this with my hatred of the ""religious"" Right in this country, but I still found myself picking up the Bible on occasion and feeling a spiritual fulfillment in Jesus's demands to give help to the poor, love thy neighbor, etc. Since finding out about Quakers and their beliefs, it seems very in line with what I already believed, but with a community of believers that I have been without since my departure from the religion of my parents. I would really like to attend a meeting, but I'm sure with COVID, my local society of friends isn't doing them.  I guess my point is, where do I go from here? Does anybody have any advice or resources for someone just dipping their toes into it that can't attend a meeting? I'd like to continue down this path, but I feel like I need to do more than watch videos about it. If this kind of post is against the rules, I apologize. Thank you for reading anyways.","Hello! So glad you found Quakers! I am a 26yo Quaker, and meetings in maaaaaany locations are gathering virtually!

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/atheism.jsonl,atheism.jsonl,14qr0k4,Would like some input about my 12 year old attending church,"I‚Äôm really conflicted about my 12 year old daughter recently wanting to go to church with her new friends. Where we live, it is incredibly hard to feel like you ‚Äúfit in‚Äù without attending church. I was very active in church at her age as well even tho my parents were not. And, I have now spent lots of time with the new friend group as they come over all the time and they all seem like kids who just go because their religious families make them, not because of any wild beliefs they actually have.  That being said, the very first youth group my daughter attended, the pastor told them, ‚Äúthere are people who are confused if they‚Äôre a boy or girl, and that‚Äôs how you can tell they‚Äôve rejected Christ and are dangerous.‚Äù ü§¨ Y‚Äôall, that‚Äôs straight up Nazi talk. When I was a kid, nothing like this was EVER said to me in church. I don‚Äôt actually think I even knew what it meant to be gay until late high school, and hell, I probably never knew about transgender until I was in my 20s or older!   These people NEVER SHUT UP about the supposed ‚Äúgay agenda‚Äù but what the problem really is that LGBTQ now enjoy some basic human rights that they did not have when I was a kid. Back when they had no rights, the Christians weren‚Äôt pissed at them, so they didn‚Äôt feel the need to discuss it ALL DAY EVERY DAY.   There is no GAY AGENDA. There is only a CHRISTIAN ANTI GAY AGENDA. No one is talking to young children about this stuff EXCEPT Christians. No one is robbing children of their innocence or childhoods EXCEPT Christians. 12 year olds shouldn‚Äôt be hearing fucking Nazi propaganda at youth group.   So my daughter was super pissed about that message so I thought cool, problem solved. But then she still wanted to go! She doesn‚Äôt attend church, only Wednesday youth groups.  Fast forward to this weekend, she got invited to a church picnic for 4th of July üôÑ She went with her friends and a set of parents so I let her go.   THEY SPOKE IN TONGUES.   My daughter came home totally skeeved out. She said they rolled on the ground and screamed words she thought ‚Äúmaybe were cuss words but she couldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù üòê Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ those of you who are ex religious may be familiar with this. Definitely tongues. Very freaking scary to see.   At any rate, she still wants to go. The other kids have no choice and she wants to be with her friends. Also, I feel that religious people will ABSOLUTELY tell her what to believe, while I believe in teaching kids where to look WITHOUT telling them what to believe. So I really don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs not just harmless silly Bible stories and pizza and prayer like when I was a kid. It‚Äôs influence from some really freaking bad people. She‚Äôs been going for like 3 months now so I would probably be the worst for putting the cabosh on now. Also, if I force her to reject church, then aren‚Äôt I just acting like the church?   What would you do?",If it that important for her to go I would probably let her. As for not telling her what to believe I don't think you should stand by a let her decide. She is still young and impressionable. Give her your perspective whenever you can. Christians have no qualms about telling their children what to believe and neither should you. When she is an adult she can decide for herself. Don't let her become indoctrinated now. It is good that she does buy into all the crazy and hate but guide her as well.,"You sound like a good parent. I have faith in you helping her navigate this intensely screwed up system, even while I lament the necessity. If she's uncomfortable, she talks to you, and gives you an opportunity to explain what has upset her, because she trusts you - that's how it should be.   Also, as a queer person?

Before I get into this I want to say I'm not interested in entertaining a debate on whether or not homosexuality is condoned or condemned in the Bible. I also want to say that I love my child unconditionally and I always will, regardless of her sexual orientation. Now on to my story...  My daughter has consciously been spending a lot more time alone in her room away from the rest of the family in the last couple months - pretty standard behavior for 13 year olds, but last night my wife noticed her quickly putting down her phone when my wife went into her bedroom. It was clearly something she didn't want us to see, so it raised our concern about what she was texting. Our biggest worry was that she could be sending or receiving inappropriate pictures. We have rule that all the phones go on the kitchen counter at bedtime, so we were able to check her phone. She had a text thread and fortunately there was nothing explicit, but there was some seemingly romantic texting between her and a female friend of hers. She has vocalized before that she knows her mom and I are not concerned about her sexual orientation and that we would still love her if she was gay...  Having said all that here are some of my questions:  Should we talk to her about this relationship even if she isn't ready to come out? I feel like there needs to be some dating boundaries set if she is in a relationship.  How should we approach sleepovers with female friends? I wouldn't allow my son to spend the night at a female friends house. How is this different?   For those of you that were around her age and had same sex relationships, what are some challenges you had that she may face?  If you were in a family that went to a church with a traditional stance on homosexuality, would you have liked to have changed to a church that was more affirming?  Finally, and other advice you could share would be appreciated.","1) I would allow her to come out when she is ready. If there was nothing inappropriate, I wouldn‚Äôt broach the subject with her yet.   2) I wouldn‚Äôt change anything about sleepovers. Just because she might be attracted to other girls doesn‚Äôt mean that she will be attracted to EVERY girl, no different than straight men and women aren‚Äôt automatically attracted to EVERY member of the opposite sex.  As for finding a church that is more affirming, I would, because no matter when she decides she‚Äôs ready to come out (if there‚Äôs anything to even come out about), she will probably feel more inclined to do so knowing that her parents have sought out a community that will accept and love her and help her continue to foster a relationship with Christ rather than condemn her.","Yeah, you really need to change to a church that's affirming. Personally I think you need to do that anyways, but when it's directly targeted at your kid? How could you stand it?  Idk about the rest, make sure you're *also* asking this in a place where people with some professional experience or education about raising queer kids can answer, and not purely take what random people probably figure as definitely true.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.8919552959
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/Quakers.jsonl,Quakers.jsonl,lqza77,Silent Worship for Discernment,"I have a question that I suppose is mostly geared toward theist Quakers.  I'm wondering about what I'm calling here silent worship for discernment.  By this, I mean entering silent worship with the hope of receiving guidance on a particular issue.  I'm wary of this, I guess because I'm aware of our capacity as humans for self-delusion.  Entering worship with a particular goal seems dangerous to me - I'm afraid that if I look for something, I will find it, whether what I found is valid or not.  I don't want to start seeing myself as capable of just sitting down and determining God/spirit's leading on any particular issue.  Or is that legitimate?  I'm thinking about this because I need to soon make a decision that is partially spiritual, and I'm trying to determine how to make that decision - whether through silent worship for discernment, or just on my own.  I don't want to exclude God/spirit if there is no reason to, but I am afraid that doing so is not the right way to go about silent worship and may lead to false conclusions.   Do you have any related thoughts for me?","Have you considered a Clearness Committee? With others, discernment (IMHO) is less likely to be delusional., And more likely to be inspirational. I've had the privilege of having Clearness Committees a few times and left feeling held, with clear next steps for ongoing discernment and revelation.  Listening and trusting are cornerstones of my practice...and while I have often been led in unexpected ways, I've always (in retrospect) been given opportunities that have been great for my continuing spiritual health. I've done things many others haven't, and had experiences of the Divine that were breathtaking.  And sometimes that was because I started with an intention of listening for something that wasn't at all what I ended up being guided towards.   (I mean I asked for clarity really wanting to receive something specific which I didn't receive. But was I did receive was so much better, and I wouldn't have dreamed of that idea without a Clearness Committee.)  Ask your Meeting's Ministry and Council if they would help you create such a committee.","Thanks very much.  As a Quaker novice, Ive heard of clearness committees but are not too familiar with them.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_active/TrueChristian.jsonl,TrueChristian.jsonl,wzvd4s,"I‚Äôm having doubts, I don‚Äôt think this is real.","First I want to say I am not having doubts about God or Jesus, but instead in the theology I was taught.  That the teaching is flawed about who God is.  For 17 years I attended a charismatic/ Pentecostal word of faith church.  Lots of teaching of activating your faith to see the super natural happen in your life, prophetic words, praying in tongues, slain in the spirit.  All of that.  But if I‚Äôm honest, it seems more of it was drumming on peoples emotions of so badly wanting to experience these things.  After a service of people falling over in the spirit (many who seemed to do it not because of God but because of the social pressure that if you don‚Äôt fall then God didn‚Äôt touch you or you weren‚Äôt letting go enough). People would almost seem to overly hype up the experience after, talking about how amazing it was, as though we were all trying to convince ourselves it was really happening, if anything it felt disingenuous and forced.  The faith part though‚Ä¶. Watching people take steps of faith, risking jobs, money, and livelihoods, and watching it not work.   Saying they know it‚Äôs Gods will, he will move on my faith.  But then making excuses how it didn‚Äôt work because the devil attacked, God is moving even bigger through this.  Instead of truly trusting God, we put more trust in our own faith and theology, that we had God figured out and knew how to make him move.  My wife got cancer at 27 years old while pregnant with our daughter.  When it was first discovered on an X-ray, we had our church gather to pray that it would disappear by the next test, that it would not be cancer but something else!  The next test was worse it was discovered to have spread.   God was with us as she gave birth while her body was in danger, healthy baby :).  We activated our faith big time! We didn‚Äôt want chemo, but the doctor levelled with us that she had 6 weeks to live if we didn‚Äôt do something. We did A whole year of no secular t,v or movies, only watching preaching to build our faith.  We pushed into our bible, and prayer.   Eventually my wife needed a stem cell transplant (a living hell of an experience)  She made it through :), we are 6years cancer free.  We never were able to faith her healing.  I do believe it is Gods grace for us to be alive at this time in history to access medical help like this.     But after, our church would have us do testimony of gods healing in front of the church. And the pastors would exaggerate the story, to make it seem like it was more faith and even bring the focus on themselves of how they helped us build faith and pray for us.  A friends mother got breast cancer last year and decided to faith her healing instead of treatment‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ she passed away.  Another very diligent faithful member of the church had their 3 year old diagnosed with leukaemia, they took medical treatment right away and she is doing well.  But some encouraged them to only pay and use faith to beat it.  Another friend in the church is currently battling cancer and tried to faith it‚Äôs healing.  It has progressed to dangerous levels, she has now accepted medical treatment.  But it could have been removed much earlier.  I recently watched another friend take a step of faith to book a plane ticket for his wife who is waiting her PR card to move here.  Saying God will bless their faith and grant her the PR card‚Ä¶.. they had to cancel the plane ticket‚Ä¶..   To question these things is seen as a lack of faith.  But I only see it as a lack of faith in the theology, not in God.  I can trust God in the unknown, when it seems bad I can trust that he is in control, and that doesn‚Äôt always mean the outcome will immediately seem good to me.  Just wanted to get this off my chest, as church friend‚Äôs seen threatened by these things and try to correct me fast.","I would have to agree with you. The tongues and healing movements, the blab-it-and-grab-it movements are very dangerous, and honestly, I have not seen one church who has been genuine in the sensationalistic denominations. You can't find being slain in the spirit, in Scripture, anywhere. Where do people get these apostate ideas? Don't answer that.  God is not a genie. God is not a slot machine.  God is God, He still heals. He still performs miracles. We really need to get over ourselves trying to ""tell God"" things like we are the ones in charge.  When a church brow beats you, or ridicules you, for lacking faith, it actually harms your faith.  It's ivory-tower elitism.","Thank you! Yes! And the teaching seems to only deem God good if good things happen to you.  The number of time people shared testimonies of the goodness of God becuase they got a new car, a great parking spot, a new job.  I agree these things we are to be thankful for, but we also only deem God good if we can brag about a blessing.  This made members who were going through a challenging time in life, feel like they must have done something wrong that God is not pouring out.  It heaped shame and negativity on them, if they are not seeing good material things, then they are doing something wrong.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.320182061

There aren't many avenues for me to ask Muslim questions about your faith. I'm a Singaporean, and here, children born in Muslim families are always brought up as Muslims as well. I've never heard of anyone leaving the religion, but I do know that anyone who does so is labeled an apostate, and would be shunned(supposedly).  May I ask several questions, note they are independent of each other.  1) Must your children be brought up as practicing Muslims? Would you allow them to live without religion (not sure how viable this is, because Islamic holidays and practices are often done as a family) till they are old enough to choose?  2) What if your children decides to leave Islam? What would your reaction be?  3) Why is it that someone who leaves Islam is an apostate? Can they ever lose this ""title"", and be referred to as whatever new religion/belief they adopt? What are your personal views of calling ex-Muslims 'apostates'?  4) Is the Quran indisputably true? The Christians have differing interpretations of the Bible; some believe it to be literally true. Some say parts of it are true. Some say it's written by men and can't be taken as anything more than a guideline. I digress; what is your view on the Quran?  Thank you!","1) Are you asking if I would *not* teach my Children my religion? That I would *not* raise them in my religious tradition? That I would not teach them what I consider to be the truth? You might as well ask if I would not teach my child a particular set of ethics or cultural/social norms until they were old enough.  2) I would try to explain and answer their objections, but assuming they did not come back to Islam...I don't exactly know how I would react. I would definitely not be happy with them.   3) An apostate is one who has committed apostasy. The *definition* of apostasy is ""renunciation of a religious faith."" Literally the meaning of the word is one who has left a religion. If you were raised Christian and become agnostic you are an apostate. In this case an apostate from Christianity. If you were raised Jewish and become Christian you are an apostate from Judaism.   One who abandoned their religion is an apostate because the word apostate means someone who abandoned their religion. They'd have to un abandon it to stop being an apostate.  4) Every word of the Qur'an is the unchanged word of God. The book contains no falsehood. This is a belief held by every Muslim group. You literally cannot be a Muslim without this belief.","In Islam many of the wrongdoings your children do will directly affect you in the afterlife, lets say you did not teach your child its wrong to have sex with anyone they want his sins would also be your sins   If i had a child and they renounced/left the religion all i could do is try  to show them the right path, i would be upset but i they would still be my child, i wouldnt beat them or kick them out  The Quran is the literal word of god simply written down by prophets, but at the same time there are a few ""schools of thoughts"" which believe slightly different interpretations of the quran, but they are usually very similar in beliefs, like when you wash before prayer one school of thought will say you have when washing your feet you have to wash to your shin and another will say to your ankle  Point being although they slightly differ the ultimately agree on the same basic translation  Sidenote: there are things called hadith, which are narrations from the prophets family and companions which basically is them noting things the prophet did and is used as an example to live by since Mohammad PBUH was considered a perfect human being religious wise",comment_1,"Displays Absolutist Language,

Sadly, this concept comes from fabricated hadith which claims that the prophet ordered the killing of dogs and gave numerous hadith that prohibit the keeping of dogs except for hunting and guarding, due to their dirty status!  However, by studying the Quran we find no such truth. Nowhere in the Quran are dogs prohibited, nor is there any mention of any contaminating effect of these lovely animals who are man's best friend. Consequently, we must dismiss all these hadith that fabricate lies against the prophet.  1- God tells us in the Quran about the story of the dwellers of the Cave (Surah 18). In verse 13 God tells us that they were good believers and that God guided them.  In verse 18 God tells us that they had their dog with them.  Now if dogs are prohibited and dirty, would God speak of those dwellers of the Cave (who had a dog) as good believers?  2- In 5:4 God tells us that it is OK to eat what the trained dogs catch (dogs are used in hunting). But if dogs are dirty would God say that it is OK to eat what they catch with their mouths?  3- There is not one verse in the Quran where God says that dogs are dirty or that they are prohibited to keep.  4- Is it logical that God would create an animal to be man's best friend and serve him in many ways, and then prohibit such an animal?  Nothing in the Islamic faith indicates that dogs are forbidden/prohibited   It differs (culturally) how dogs are accepted in households some cultures frown upon it others are open for it.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/religion.jsonl,religion.jsonl,ps97g8,What do you think of listening to music inspired by a religion other than your own?,"Many of the metal bands I used to listen to sing predominantly about Norse mythology. Singing about mythology is one thing, but many of these bands are neo-pagans who do seriously worship the Aesir. Of course, quite a few of them, I think are just using their genre to go on a geeky tirade about how kewl Thor is. Their progenitors though did genuinely believe it, and obviously so. There was a rash of church burnings in Norway tied to the genre in its early years, and many bands were directly involved in this too. And even today, the genre is heavily defined by opposition to Christianity, even if they try to be far more welcoming and friendly than their often openly white-supremacist predecessors.   For my entire adult life so far, I've thought about how much I would have to change about my life if I ever returned to the religion of my birth. I would pretty much have to give up all my hobbies and interests.   Of course, listening to music that bashes on your religion is one thing, but what about listening to more benevolent music that's clearly inspired by beliefs that are heretical to you? I know Christians often take issue with d&amp;d and how it requires you to play a polytheistic character. Of course, its not really a requirement; you could just make your own setting where there's only one god, but even then I've seen people take issue with how clerics are depicted. One thing I've seen is that they have the power to raise the dead, a feat that only Jesus is supposed to be capable of. Of course, this feature was mainly added for convenience (its rather annoying having a really high level character die on you, especially considering how hard it used to be to get a character to live to see even level 2). A lot of folk and european power metal is a similar problem. They glorify pagan gods, oppose Christian teachings, and as stated many do seriously worship the gods they sing about.  Living my whole life in America, obviously you don't see songs being written by anyone who isn't either Christian or atheist. Even then, artists normally prefer to stick to secular topics, outside of gospel music anyway. Point is, its not normal in America to listen to music about a religion other than Christianity. I mean, Americans don't even know about folk metal. Satanism used to be strongly associated with metal, and for many still is, but that's about it. Of course, most of these supposedly satanic groups were actually atheists trying to shock people, and the lead singer of Slayer even confessed to being a Roman Catholic who just had an interest in horror stories. I only know of one American satanic act that was headed by an actual satanist, but he was a non-theisitic kind, so he didn't even literally believe the devil existed. Essentially, he was just a fan of Paradise Lost for all intents and purposes. I do know of a few others, but they're all based in Europe and wouldn't be recognizable to an American. Any American can tell you who Slayer is, but you'd be really hard pressed to find anyone whose heard of Behemoth or Gorgoroth. Point is, you never hear music in America from a religion other than Christianity, and even if you do its all just an act and the artists aren't expressing genuine belief. Actually, they're normally just trying to shock people.   Of course, it makes sense that people of different religions would take little interest in the gospel music of other religions, but Norse paganism is different in that its 'gospel' music is literally metal! Of course, not all of them are actual pagans, but many are and they originally dominated the genre. Clearly, it draws interest from people outside the religion. I mean, I used to listen to it all the time, and I've never been a pagan of any sort.   Really though, if you do practice a religion, is it okay to listen to the music of another religion? Is there any detriment to doing that? Would it normally even interest a person? Again, I'm just thinking about all the things I would have to leave behind if I became Christian again. Honestly, I'd pretty much have to become a completely different person. Of course, my community is dominated by trump-supporting evangelicals who seriously still believe in the satanic panic, and seem to think the only media that isn't part of a satanic plot is the Bible. I mean, they'd probably find a way to take issue with even Pureflix's movies in all seriousness. Yeah, most Christians may or may not be like that, but that's what my entire community is like, so if I returned to Christianity, I'd have little choice but to join them. Besides, it is the religion of my youth, so if I was to return to Christianity that's what I would return to. Joining any other wouldn't constitute a return really.","I am a Hindu who of course loves the singing and music prayers from my own religion. I also love Buddhist and Benedictian chants.

Basically, it underpins radical secularism with *Christian mythology* in particular, proposing that:   * Man only became truly man when they committed the ‚Äòoriginal sin‚Äô.    * The ‚Äòoriginal sin‚Äô not only is what made man seek ‚Äòtruth‚Äô, ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô, ‚Äòwisdom‚Äô and ‚Äòpower‚Äô, but also what created our understanding of ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòevil‚Äô. (Hence, Adam and Eve feel ashamed for being unclad, while God doesn‚Äôt see any issue in their nudity per se.)   * ‚ÄòGood‚Äô and ‚Äòevil‚Äô are human categories, i.e., meaningful only to humans. They are not dominions of divinity. From the POV of the divine, everything is ‚Äògood as is‚Äô.   * Death does not promote humans, it demotes them to a sub-human state of intolerable heteronomy by stripping them off their incarnation. (Hence our *horror naturalis.*)   * **Man‚Äôs ultimate goal is not to ‚Äòenter Heaven‚Äô or ‚Äòreturn to the Nirvana‚Äô or anything to that extent, but to** ***promote incarnation and the joy of life.***  From this, it follows that    * Radical Satanists know no hubris. Instead, ***they embrace fear as a guide.*** They are perfectly aware that they‚Äôre on God‚Äôs short leash, being subject to luck, chance, fate, determinism, etc. This, however, does not incur servility in them, but all-the-more calls for renitency and resilience.   * ***‚ÄòHuman sacrifice‚Äô*** in Radical Satanism aims not at ending the respective human‚Äôs life to appease one or more deities, but ***‚Äòto play God‚Äô*** by carefully ***withdrawing that human*** from their natural morbidity, and thus from God, if only for another day. Thus, ***the operating tables are our ‚Äòsacrificial altars‚Äô, the physicians our ‚Äòpriests‚Äô.*** Indeed, ***MODERN MEDICINE*** is *THE* quintessential ***Satanist science and practice.*** Medicine is ***rebellion.***   * The color of Radical Satanism isn‚Äôt black. Black is a deeply Christian/theistic color. It represents nihilism ‚Äì the disdain for the carnal and the secular. The color of Radical Satanism is ***50% gray,*** produced through means like *RGB noise*, preferably.   * Radical Satanist music isn‚Äôt loud. Radical Satanist music isn‚Äôt martial, fierce or shocking. Radical Satanist music, if you will, ***is ‚Äòcreepy‚Äô.*** It is narcotic, it is seductive, it is ***catchy.*** Radical Satanist music is ***Easy Listening.***   * ***Drugs are your friend.*** Your body ‚Äì your *flesh* ‚Äì uses them all the time. Yes: you get them *FOR FREE*, courtesy of your incarnation. Drugs are an integral part of experiencing life. Without them, there basically would be no life at all. Even food essentially is a drug! Drugs and (the joy of) life are basically inseparable. It's when you lose your incarnation that you truly go ‚Äòcold turkey‚Äô. Doesn‚Äôt sound so fancy now, does it?   * The ‚ÄòPatron Saint‚Äô of Radical Satanism is ***Hygieia***, daughter of *Asclepius*, because she feeds the serpent.   * The mascot of Radical Satanism is ***Goldilocks***, because she demonstrates the precedence of human needs and interests.

What brought on my conversion to humanism is the issues with the feminism movement because it just doesn't work now that the rights of females are equal, but discrimination and ignorance still abounds. So I realized that feminism couldn't help as much anymore.  My question to humanism is how big is the movement and what is it doing (and how can I help) to help diminish the fighting that is going on with homophobia and misogyny. These two seem to be of equal greatest importance and even have great similarities, especially when they come together as child abuse. At least in the United States, with racism following very closely after that.  I think the United States and other ""First World"" countries are the most important to settle these disputes, because if we do so for ourselves, then we'll at least know how to counsel other countries IF they ask for our help or act as a role model IF they follow in our footsteps.  Lastly, does humanism have anything to do with non-interventive ideas? Or does it not care how it settles these disputes?  Thanks!","Hmm, some others may disagree, but I would answer your questions as follows:   - humanism is not a social movement, it is a philosophy/ethical perspective. The term has existed since the mid-1800s and its roots lie in the 1500s. There are both religious and secular humanists.   - that being said, there are humanist organizations and I assume most of them are working to articulate humanism, but I can't say for certain as I don't keep tabs on any of them.   - I suspect your last two questions would make sense if we were talking about a movement and not a philosophy... but as it is, I can't say I understand how to answer those questions given the context.","I think the biggest American Humanist organization is probably the AHA, ""American Humanist Association:"" http://www.americanhumanist.org/  You can find local Humanist meetups, read Humanist news, donate, read about the organization, etc. etc.  I wonder how big Humanism is as well.

It has to do with how we treat others. ‚ÄúJust as you  want men to do to you, do the same way to them,‚Äù said Jesus. ([Luke 6:31](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/luke/6/#v42006031))  And what good things he did for people! Jesus cured the sick and even  raised the dead. Individuals were especially blessed, however, when they  accepted the good news he shared with them. (*Read* [*Luke 7:20-22*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/luke/7/#v42007020-v42007022)*.*) As Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, we are delighted to engage in similar Kingdom-preaching activity.

Its difficult to live in the present and then still have the same mindset that we will continue to live for another 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years etc., but **we can do it.** With day to day practice and connection with the energy that is external from us.  **Today:** Try something new. Try something that you have been wanting to for the past little while. Try something that is causing fear or anxiety on your life. Try something that even if you don't know, deep down you know its the right step for you; starting a business, writing poetry, making art, having a conversation with someone etc., thats up to you to decide what to do but I know and **I believe in you**, that you will get it done.  **I love you.**  Drey &lt;3",Drey I'm curious.

Upon discovering Buddhism, it really appealed to me as a philosophy and religion. However, what I am having trouble understanding is what the religion says on studying and/or working hard in life. Isn't studying and working hard useless if we're all just part of the cycle of rebirth and suffering? Shouldn't I be devoting more time to ending my own suffering and the suffering of others if I don't go to school or work hard? I'm very confused. It may be accredited to my lack of motivation to study or my misinterpretation of Buddhist texts. Please help me understand. Thanks.","Unless you're going to live as a monastic renouncing all sense desires for the sake of achieving nibbana, the level of study and hard work as far as an occupation goes is up to you. If you choose to live the lay life you might as well live it comfortably as possible, which means studying and hard work. That's just my opinion though, others may work just enough to support certain desires while dedicating a lot of time to practice. Both are valid.  Bear in mind you're not spiritually damned just because you aren't aiming for nibbana right here and now, it is still possible for a layperson to attain as high as anagami (one step short of arahantship).",So part of Buddhism is aimed at having a comfortable physical life?,comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.2364882855

Even though I'm exmuslim, I like learning about Islam and the history because I find it interesting. I speak Arabic but I've been looking for some help with old Arabic from a non biased source.79:30 in the Quran talks of god spreading the earth flat, which I always took as an error in the Quran although some people are saying that the word ""Da7aha"" means ""shaped like an egg"" instead of ""flattened"" its very confusing and all sources on this seem biased one way or another so I hope learning more will allow me to come to a conclusion on this as well as other things. I kind of sidetracked here, but anyway...  I found this website quite good so I thought I'd share for anyone else having similar problems.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/tellusofyourgods.jsonl,tellusofyourgods.jsonl,rr221,Coping,"Forgive me for this post; it is simply a good way for me to get things out of my system.   Last night around 7pm my great grandfather died at the age of 99, he was a wonderful man who spent the last of his years working to uplift people spiritually. Even with my non-belief I cannot think badly of him going around the home he was in trying to comfort other people as he himself was at death's door.   Even when I had faith, I did not have a good coping mechanism. I drank, I joked, and I avoided people as much as possible. Unfortunately in my family that is like avoiding breathing, because they are always there ‚Äúfor you‚Äù. Now as an atheist I really have the same options for coping, although I have cut the drinking back a bit. The biggest road block that is in my way when comes to coping is my father‚Äôs recent return to the church, focusing on his new ‚Äúpassive‚Äù attempts to convert me back to the flock.   Here is how last night went down;  720: dad calls to tell me Gramps died, short talk then we hang up and he calls my brother.  730: i call my mother (parents currently getting divorced after 31 years of marriage)  745: my father calls and tells me not to be sad, and that gramps is in where he wanted to be, and that he almost got the 100 years that he wanted out of life. then proceeds to tell me about gramps' recent attempts to help those about to die cope with this if they want his help. then he goes into a semi-religious diatribe about death and afterlife. and he throws in that if life begins at conception then gramps got his 100 years.   I know this is my father‚Äôs coping mechanism, but it is driving me up the wall and I don‚Äôt know how much of it I will be able to take before I snap on him and his newly found religious faith. I do not want to be one of those people.    i just don't know what to do, as i said i am sorry for throwing this all on you but this is what i can do while at work and not allowed to drink.","I don't know if you're looking for help coping, but I know coming from a non-belief background can make things difficult. Consider this Einstein quote; ""Us physicists believe the separation between past, present, and future is only an illusion, although a convincing one."" Your grandfather's life, impact, and memory is as real today as it was yesterday. Some people like to realize this in terms of religion, others prefer to understand it in a secular framework. It doesn't really matter so long as you do not allow the reality of his death affect the reality of his life. If you need a way to cope, take what is is that you love about your grandfather, and make sure that it lasts in memory and that you carry the torch of that tradition. Don't allow someone else's grieving have an effect on your own. Death of a parent is a humbling experience, and your father probably feels control over his life slipping away. Finding religion is some people's way of trying to regain some of that control. As hard as it is, try not to loose it on him. If he feels you slipping away too, it'll probably only make things worse. Find the truth he is trying to convey to you, put it in terms you find palatable, and just understand that this is his way of trying to reach out to you. Sorry if this was unwelcome, and if it was, kindly disregard.","almost all comments are welcome, thank you.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.1048860856

I understand why others believe what they believe and respect that provided they aren't harming others with said beliefs. To be fair, we never were the stereotypical Christian family. (ie. pray before bed, say grace, go to church every Sunday) In actuality, I only really remember going to church for VBS over the summer, because my mom wanted me to learn what she learned as a child. I was never really forced to be religious but for a long period of my life I just kinda accepted it to be as factual as the idea that the sky is blue and it hung over me constantly. As I got older, I realized that the things I was spoon-fed by counselors at summer camp were actually beliefs, which don't necessarily have to be accepted. That being said, ever since I realized that it wasn't mandatory for me to go through life repenting to a god I didn't believe was there, I identified myself as an atheist.  Within the past year, I discovered that ethnically speaking, I am actually Jewish. My grandparents attempted to raise my father and my aunt's and uncles as Jewish but the local synagogue accused my grandfather of being stingy and not donating enough money so they left. This was all before my father, who is the oldest child, was able to have his bar mitzvah. In the end, they were never able to find a good synagogue and religion kind of fell out of their lives. I remember in elementary school, we did activities around the holidays which were inclusive of Jewish traditions and I always loved these activities, even more so than the Christian ones. (Unfortunately, from what I remember, Jewish and Christian holidays were the only ones included)  In addition, recently I have been introduced to the ideas of paganism/wicca/witchcraft. (I known it's not all the same but I'm still getting into this) Again, as I said above, I really don't believe in a god, or the presence of any gods. However, I like the connection to nature and working spells and reading tarot cards, even if I don't truly believe that there is a higher power behind it all.  So this brings me to my questions.  Is this offensive to those who truly practice and believe in these religions and/or god/gods? Can I not believe in a higher power but still want to practice the traditions and ideas behind these theistic religions? How can I learn more about these religions and traditions, without offending people? I want to maybe try going to a synagogue to learn more about traditions but I worry about offending others.  Overall, my main question is: Can I be an Atheist, Jewish, Witch?","I can't answer for the rest, but considering that it's your father that's Jewish, you're not actually considered Jewish by any major denomination. By Jewish Law, Jewishness is inherited through the mother, not the father and in the case of the liberal Reform movement, through the father only in the case where the child was raised under Jewish tradition.","so, these tarot cards you read - what's the intelligence behind that?",comment_1,"Displays Absolutist Language,

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,o6j5q4,A different kind of LPE,"Found this on Plato.Stanford, a ""Humean"" argument against theism that is like the LPE:      1. The distribution of suffering in the world is more to be expected on naturalism than theism. 2. Naturalism is at least approximately as simple a theory as theism. 3. If 1 &amp; 2, then naturalism is a better explanation of evil than theism. 4. If 3, then the evidence of evil confirms naturalism over theism.  &amp;#x200B;  I can see where a skeptical theist would say ""evil"" is not the right idea for what they are trying to say proves no god.   I'm not overly convinced, but it is sort of clever if you need a ""common sense"" argument for naturalism.","I think the jump from (3) to (4) is too much. Going from saying ""naturalism is a better explanation than theism for the existence of evil"" to ""confirming naturalism"" is too much. It's like saying that naturalism is 60% likely to be true given the existence of evil therefore naturalism is true.   So I would just leave it as saying you think naturalism is a better explanation for the existence of evil than theism. Honestly, I think theists should concede this point. It's just a matter of whether you have other arguments for theism and just how improbable you think this argument renders theism (does it make naturalism 60% likely or 90% likely?).   I think the Argument from Suffering is a good argument against theism, but at the same time I don't think it's enough to bring me from agnosticism to atheism.","3 is the part I like about it, it includes Occam's Razor, and if one is a materialist it's a good check on theism.  But yeah, going into 4 it is too probabilistic for my tastes, it doesn't necessarily follow if one isn't a devoted materialist.  I have been looking into skeptical theism and this pops up as a possible answer to their criticism of the LPE (criticisms with which I agree with TBH).    Here there is no blaming god for evil, just saying that the suffering and such that is natural wouldn't lead one to believe in a god as that would make things more complicated than if one didn't.  The main criticism of the LPE being that just because we don't see the good, doesn't mean it isn't there (I would revise that to ""we can't think of good separate from beneficial to humans"") in an event.  I agree, I don't find it convincing (I have yet to find a convincing argument either way TBH).",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.6384492762

But I believe that this is just a way for people to avoid the uncomfortable realization that the way they are doing something is wrong, and avoiding the added discomfort of having to change.  Bad iconography, a choir or chanter‚Äôs poor execution of music, a Priest‚Äôs liturgical omissions and mistakes being regularized and the inclusion of Protestant and Catholic liturgical practices are examples of where people try to use the idea of ‚Äútradition‚Äù (as opposed to ‚ÄúTradition‚Äù) to justify continuing to make mistakes and continuing incorrect practices that separate their practice from the rest of the Orthodox world.  This excuse is very prideful and un-Orthodox; even if people aren‚Äôt aware they are doing it. One of Orthodoxy‚Äôs big features is our unity in practice, and the idea of always striving foe further perfection in our spiritual lives and our liturgical lives.   The moment we start to accept a notion of ‚Äúit‚Äôs just how we do it here‚Äù to justify mediocrity, is the moment we abandon our sense of liturgical sanctity, the idea that what we do should be continual perfection and unity with one another.  Please, stop using the language of ‚Äúits just a tradition‚Äù, and start humbling yourself to the uncomfortable realization that you may be doing something wrong, and to seek to start doing something more correct.","My favourite was when visiting another church, OCA, someone told me that talking during communion was just one of their traditions...","This silly. Everyone has local traditions, if it's unimportant like the examples you gave and people like it let them do it. Unity of practice is not important to Orthodoxy, the universal standardization of services is a recent innovation done for several reasons, most notably to hold the community together after the empire fell. Did you know that every Holy week service is post-Byzantine and the tradition of doing them early in anticipation is even more recent? Did you know that the antiphons used in the Greek Church were developed in the 19th century? Did you know that almost all of the octoechos is late Byzantine? This doesn't even get into stuff that's changed since the apostolic age, when you never had Priests celebrating alone and the Bishop's prayers were improvised. There is continuity but the Liturgy is always evolving, and all of these changes started with the local traditions that so piss you off.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.6838082275

Satan kills 10. Who is the more evil one?  -God says everyone has to worship him for all eternity. What kind of self-centered egomaniac demands that?  -What did Satan do? He stood up for himself. He said he wasn‚Äôt going to give in to God‚Äôs demand to be worshiped. How is that a crime?  -What happened to the three day old babies when the flood of Noah came? Don‚Äôt envision a worldwide flood‚Äîhold in your mind the image of a single crib with a single baby, slowly drowned by the cold, dark waters. What could that child have possibly done?  -Original sin? You mean holding people guilty for things over which they have no control. How is that remotely just?  -God made us in his image? What is more likely: that, or that we made him in our image? The god of the Bible is self-admittedly petty, jealous, and vengeful‚Äîjust like we are. Is it not more probable that we made him in our image?  -Do you think slavery is okay? The bible supports it. It says you can have slaves as long as you don‚Äôt gouge out their eyes or break their teeth. Yeah, that makes it moral.  -The bible says that you are to kill those who attempt to lead you away from God. I admit that right now, I am trying to undermine your faith and turn you into an atheist. Kill me. Do it. I won‚Äôt even defend myself. Why aren‚Äôt you?  -Moses tells his soldiers to rape the virgin daughters of their enemy. Do you support this?  -Jesus said ‚Äúlet he who is without sin cast the first stone‚Äù. Why are so many Christian so damn judgmental then?  -Muslims believe theirs is the one true god too. And that they will go to heaven. And that anyone of another religion will go to hell. These are all things you believe too. How are you any different from them?  -Which is more likely, that Mary conceived as a virgin, or that Joseph knocked her up. Billions of people have gotten pregnant the old fashion way‚Äîwhich is more likely here?  -What happens to the billions of people who never even hear of your path to salvation? How is sending them to hell for all eternity merciful or just when they have no choice in the matter?  -You hold roughly the same religious beliefs as your parents and your country. So does 99% of everyone else in every other religion. What‚Äôs more likely, that yours is the one true religion, or that we all just get brainwashed into our parents belief system?  -How do you know the bible is true? Name one thing that it says that could not have been written by uneducated desert tribesmen 2,000 years ago. The cures for polio and small pox, for example, can be written in just a few pages. Why doesn‚Äôt the bible contain anything like that?  -Some Christians argue that the New Testament made the Old Testament obsolete. Does this mean you‚Äôre willing to abandon the whole creationism farce and acknowledge that evolution is fact?  -Why do believers not regrow limbs? Surely some of our heroes coming home from war with missing body parts are true believes, from believing families, from pious communities. Why can not a single amputee with such a strong belief regrow a limb, or have some other miracle that would in no way be explainable by science?  -Why do communities, states, and nations with higher rates of religious belief also have worse indicators of quality of life and societal good. For example, the Deep South of the US is known to be very religious. Why does it have higher rates of crime, domestic violence, infant mortality, and other such social indicators? Same for, say, pious Central America versus Western Europe.  -Why do I need to believe in god in order to be amazed at the wonder of nature? Can‚Äôt I just believe it‚Äôs beautiful without having to believe there is some sky daddy at the bottom of it all.  -If religion is necessary for morality, then why do organizations like the National Academy of Sciences, whose members are over 95% atheist, have so few members committing crimes?  -Why aren‚Äôt Christian funerals big parties? If you truly believe you‚Äôre all going to heaven after you die, why is it not a massive celebration? Why are Christians not all taking up base jumping and volunteer fire fighting?  -The bible says that it is an abomination for a man to lie with another man. The very next verse says that the penalty for doing so is death. Do you advocate the death penalty for homosexuality?  -No, damn it, Hitler was a Catholic, not an atheist. Please do your research before using that one again. But I don‚Äôt blame Catholicism for what Hitler did, any more than I blame atheism for what Stalin and Mao did. Mad men can be mad for reasons far beyond religion.  -As an atheist, I‚Äôm just like you‚ÄîI‚Äôm kind to others, I love my family, I continually try to be a better person. I just don‚Äôt need the threat of hell or promise of heaven to do it.  -As an atheist, I too try to live by the Golden Rule, but I don‚Äôt need a god or an ancient text to see the wisdom of the rule. I do unto others as I‚Äôd have done to me because I know this is the right thing to do, and it makes me happy when I do.  -As an atheist, I agree that it is not enough to just say what you‚Äôre against. That‚Äôs why I am also a Secular Humanist. Other atheists may hold different positive views, but we are more than just anti-religious.  -As an atheist, I enjoy sex to its fullest. Particularly in my single years! As long as everyone consents (including my spouse once married, if polyamory happens to be our thing), then I don‚Äôt have to worry about the opinion of a god or his threats to my eternal disposition.  -As an atheist, I don‚Äôt give up 10% of my income year over year, meaning I can retire 5 years earlier.  -As an atheist, I deal with death by telling the people I love that I love them every chance I get. That way when they or I go, the one who survives can have the peace of knowing that we loved each other to the fullest.  Guys, care to explain/deconstruct one by one?","&gt; -What happened to the three day old babies when the flood of Noah came? Don‚Äôt envision a worldwide flood‚Äîhold in your mind the image of a single crib with a single baby, slowly drowned by the cold, dark waters. What could that child have possibly done?  This question, and others like it (Ex. ""What happens to all those poor people in other countries who never hear the gospel??"") are just distractions from the real issue, which is: What is YOUR decision?   Even if we had a ""satisfactory"" answer to their question, there would only be more questions, and more deflections from their real issue, which is their own, individual need for God. Instead of chasing that rabbit trail, turn the discussion back to, ""What is YOUR decision? Let God be the Just Judge of their condition...what is your condition?"" (Scripture reference: John 21:20-23)  &gt; -Muslims believe theirs is the one true god too. And that they will go to heaven. And that anyone of another religion will go to hell. These are all things you believe too. How are you any different from them?  What makes us different is a Risen Savior. Read the New Testament, especially the first sermons preached by the first apostles. Their entire message centered on the fact that, yes, Jesus was a great man, a great teacher, did miracles, etc. But the main thing was that Jesus was bodily raised to life by God, as an expression of God's approval of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.   No other religion can boast of an empty tomb. In fact, Muslims are commanded to go to Mecca, which is....Mohammed's tomb. Supposedly his body is still there. But you can go to Jerusalem, to a garden tomb outside the wall, and there is an empty tomb. At that point, they start deflecting, saying, ""Well, you don't know, that's not the right tomb,"" etc. etc. ad nauseum. Yes, we do know, and with a reasonable amount of certainty.   Jesus was bodily raised from the dead, a fact we celebrate every Easter, and is something that no other religious system has any claim to. That's what makes us different. Other religions have morality, even good morality, tenets, beliefs and practices.   Only one has an empty tomb.   I have answers for most, if not all the other questions, just not the time to answer them all in detail. If there are specific ones that give you trouble, please ask me.","OP, your list is not referenced, and too long to tackle for anyone with a life. But I‚Äôll take on one, even though, reading through, I have answers for many, if not all.   You state: ""Moses tells his soldiers to rape the virgin daughters of their enemy."" I assume that you are referring to Numbers 31.  The Israelite army fought against Midian. The LORD commanded Moses to do this. The Midianites had purposefully chosen to attack the Hebrew‚Äôs faith by sending their women in to seduce the Israelite men and getting them to worship idols. The nation of Israel (as a whole) was not strong in their faith, and it was important for them to be protected from such attacks.  The army obeyed and killed all the men, wiping out the nation. However, the grown women had been just as much a part of the attack against the Hebrew‚Äôs faith as the men had been. Moses was angry that the army hadn‚Äôt completed the job.  The compassionate part of this is that Moses spared the virgins, who were obviously not part of seducing anyone, because they were virgins. And then, more than just allowing them to live, he instructed them to  ‚Äúsave for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.‚Äù (Numbers 31:18 NASB) Then in the very next breath (v 19), Moses tells them to purify themselves and their captives. This was a seven day process, that would not include sex at all. Rape was against the law, and even consensual sex would have nullified the whole purification process.  The men in the army had seen God punish law-breaking with death, and they had just witnessed a plague that came from relations with the Midianite women. (Numbers 25:1-9) Everyone who had slept with a Midianite woman had been executed. It is doubtful that the best of the best (chosen for the army) ‚Ä¶ men who had already NOT slept with any Midianite women ‚Ä¶ would suddenly want to go anywhere near one.  Instead, please see that it was merciful and compassionate to give these girls a home and a job rather than turning them out onto the streets or worse, out into the desert. Being taken captive at this point, means having a place to live, food to eat and ultimately, a family.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.7862798243
data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,lcsvnd,Religion and the construction of individual freedom,"-- in title *constriction instead of construction)  Religion boxes in your true potential by limiting your beliefs, ideals and ways of behaving by making promises of an imaginary afterlife, or pleasant life circumstances, if you follow the rules(usually in the form of a spiritual doctrine) of an outside exterior superpower or God through worship.  This was something I wrote the other day on my Facebook profile, but I figured I would post here and get thoughts, opinions or a discussion going.  Btw, can you edit titles in a post? Forgive me, I'm slightly new to Reddit!","The immediate criticism is that wild undirected freedom (freedom without correct understanding of its natures, conditions, limits, hence potentials) leads to corruption.   The limits can be either internal or external, though Vedas/Buddhism say the internal is the only one that matters, but that relies on the ontology of radical oneness (between world as it appears, which includes the self, and the ultimate real true reality); Judaism etc say if u had not confronted the radical other (which can be only external, or paradoxically internal as well as external), u had not approached the true divine.   Genuine religious/spiritualism would expand the beliefs/ideals/ways of behavior as the adept acquires, attains, develops. Sometimes a limit/shearing is needed for the purpose of fostering future development (this u certainly understand).   If a school/teaching truly limits/oppresses/kills without anything as a result of it. This is truly horrible and shld not be considered as anything of worth.   But if a school might teach a goodness is possibilized by (and after) a state of limited, senseless oppression, unfreedom &amp; death, their limitations are legitimate.","&gt; Religion boxes in your true potential by limiting your beliefs, ideals and ways of behaving by making promises of an imaginary afterlife, or pleasant life circumstances, if you follow the rules(usually in the form of a spiritual doctrine) of an outside exterior superpower or God through worship      This assumes that the religion one follows is a wholly false one, but would not serve as an argument against any actual religious person, as it begs the question. Even of a false religion, it is a vacuous criticism. Religions usually survive and thrive because they enable adherents to do something which is not easily done on their own. They provide a platform of accumulated wisdom and a cohesive set of expectations with which to approach the world, and a safety net of solidarity to rely on in tough times. One's 'true potential' is rarely realised as a rootless individual, since one is left to reinvent the wheel on one's own, blown about by every change of circumstance, cobbling together a makeshift philosophy and temporary social alliances out of whatever cultural detritus happens to stick. The highest forms of human achievement require a consistent commitment, aided by a multitude of others of like mind, drawing upon accumulated wisdom far beyond one's own finite lifetime, in service of lofty ends which are worth sacrificing for. This entails making significant choices, ruling out some as erroneous and futile, while being prepared to make commitments which one cannot then walk back. It is precisely in adopting a 'box', a filter that allows one to meaningfully engage with reality rather than being distracted by all the noise, that things get done. Of course, there are better and worse 'filters,' but my point is that it is not the mere adoption of a set way of thinking and behaving which 'limits' one's potential for the good.  Personally, as a Christian I have not found my religion to be terribly limiting. Indeed, it is liberating. One is liberated from chronological snobbery (i.e., a partisan attachment to one's own time), and even if one disagrees with others religious traditions, can at least take the religious instincts of others seriously. One is liberated from confinement to crass materialism, since Christianity gives even the crudest layman a reason to be concerned with ultimate questions. Because all truth is God's truth, and God is the source of the intelligibility of all things, the Christian faith endows one with a broad curiosity, yet one which checks both intellectual arrogance and despair  One is liberated from existential dead-ends, such as the illusion of self-sufficiency (because God, not me, is the ultimate author of my existence) on the one hand or of helpless fatalism on the other (because, whatever circumstances may limit my achievement of the human good, in God, those circumstances will eventually be overcome). The vision of Heaven points out the things most worth cultivating here and now, since it is only the virtues one cultivates and the trajectory of a life lived sacrificially for others which will survive death. It raises my spiritual ambition- to live a truly good life, rather than just a 'good-enough' life. To realise the magnitude of the project of living a truly good life is precisely to realise that one needs nothing less than God's help.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.1254643658

She recently got sober from drugs and alcohol and became a follower or Christ. She always tells me to pray and prays I will get a sign from god. We talked for about an hour and a half and she was talking about god and stuff and I questioned it and asked why the bible wasn‚Äôt just a story someone made a long time ago and idk I was wanting to believe and I was gonna read the kids bible cause it‚Äôs easy and I just wanna know the story because a lot of effort would have been put into it and can be something good to believe in because it teaches you good morals and stuff and I‚Äôd like to be a good person but I was like praying in the back of my head last night and just saying if this story is real give me a sign and and just kinda prayed about it in the back of my mind because my mom always tells me to pray for a sign and pray for things in life and I try to do it because there isn‚Äôt any harm in believing but is if you don‚Äôt believe and stuff then there could be harm in not believing. so I want a sign and then continued talk for the hour and a half about my faith and what I want to believe in and why I don‚Äôt and never believed because I never had a sign, I mean weird things have always happened that make me question it and I listen to my mom and her story and that makes me question it more. My dad doesn‚Äôt believe and I grew up with him so it was never really forced upon me in any way as a child. After talking I think I got a fucking sign so god is either real or the biggest fucking coincidence happened in life but someone try and explain it because it was the weirdest thing and I‚Äôm sure people can explain it in a logical way. My mom about to answer me so right after I finished speaking about how I needed a sign to make me actually believe this happened. I just finished speaking and before my mom could reply the phone line l cut out and it started beeping but like the beeping that happens when you call a number that isn‚Äôt in service anymore or used to happen if you know what I mean and it was that beeping noise then I just hung up because I was stoned and got really sketched out but on my moms phone it said I hung up and ended her call and mine just started beeping. When it ended on my moms phone it made the noise it usually makes on phones when someone hangs up before you. Was this a sign from god or just a weird fucking coincidence","imho, and being a believer in God.  I would lean towards it was a sign.  It certainly possible that God disconnected that call.  Were you asking for a specific sign?  There are dozen of logical ways to dismiss this as a sign form God.  However, I like to focus on how did it make you feel?  Was it significant enough for you to believe?  Does it increase your faith in God.  In the fact your asking and then you receive an incident that is unusual.  I believe in God and I pray all the time, I don't test God to show me signs.  However, the words or feelings I get when a prayer is answered leave no doubt in my entire being. Thats why I asked how did it make you feel?  I hope and pray you find God because He would certainly disconnect a call for you to talk to Him more in prayer.",At first I got worried because it‚Äôs not something that happened before while I was on a call. I have an iPhone and usually when calls drops it will pop up on my phone and say call back but it didn‚Äôt do this and I just found it strange because I haven‚Äôt experienced a drop call in that way. It made me feel good because if it was a sign of god that gives me a lot of hope in life that things  I‚Äôll be better and that there is a plan for me. I do believe everything happens for a reason but find myself always questioning why specific things happen and my mom always says god and I question it a lot but I think I believe more now and even if this was just a dropped call and happened at the right time I won‚Äôt believe there is harm in believing even if it isn‚Äôt real because it will make me a better person not only for myself but the people around me. I have been really lost lately and questioning lots and I don‚Äôt know but it was just really weird and I got happy after because of it was a sign from god that gives me so much hope and makes me feel like I have someone to talk to and open up to about my struggles in life and it will help me find the motivation to get past it. I joked about it all day how I‚Äôm going to become a Christian now and told everyone what happened and most people just thought I was crazy and it was only a dropped call but the fact it happened at that exact moment was very weird and makes me question so much. My plan is to learn more about it and ask all my questions to help me grow a relationship with god because there isn‚Äôt any harm in it even if it isn‚Äôt real but I would like to believe it is because it will help me a lot with some personal issues I have.

What purpose do these rules serve? Do you follow them? Why?,"Good question! I am a Vaishnava, and we definitely have rules about food! I'll start out by saying that these are actually more like guidelines for those interested in spirituality; they facilitate behaviors that are conducive to developing transcendental knowledge.   The first guideline is to not eat meat, fish, or eggs. In modern society, some people have started extending this to dairy. The idea is that to develop love for God, we have to understand what love is. We have to practice it and be able to love our fellow living entities. The seed of love is compassion. Killing and causing suffering to animals is considered to be inconsistent with and counterproductive to the goal of learning compassion.   There are also rules to limit or eliminate the consumption of intoxicants and onions &amp; garlic. These are both based on the effect these have on the psyche, hampering clear vision and intelligence.  Finally, a serious practitioner will offer all food to God before eating it. This sanctifies the food and turns what is normally simply an act of sense gratification into a meditation on God and an act of devotion. Our tradition teaches that God doesn't really want us to offer the carcasses of other creatures. So, if one is going to eat only sanctified food, that can't include meat, fish, or eggs.",Very interesting!

However, the concept of a violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie doesn't seem to jive with our following Jesus' example.  That's the way of Barabas and the Zealots, not Jesus' way of radical love and peace.  So what are some pacifist, Christ-centered strategies to overthrow the capitalist means of production?","This won't give a full answer, but it might provide a little perspective. Often when we think of pacifism, we think ""passive-ism"". Pacifism does not mean being passive, it simply means a turning away from violence. So I can do things that subvert the system that aren't physically violent.   This could mean, for instance, that the proletariat (as a whole), stop paying taxes to an oppressive bourgeois serving government. It could mean standing in front of tanks as they try to plow people down. It could mean something as simple as refusing to buy products from certain areas.","Hey there, I'm not a pacifist, but I sometimes play one on the internet.   Ultimately, the material conditions of any struggle define the mode of struggle undertaken.  Sticking idealistically to any one struggle is too rigid to really combat any kind of hegemonic system that is as nimble as capital.    Even more, there are huge theoretical problems with the idea of pacifism.  My thesis is that pacifism does not have the capacity to really understand violence as more than simply physical violence.  This is an obvious shortcoming that Marxism and Anarchism can thoroughly delineate.  Violence is physical, of course, but also has a hugely economic, political and social factor.    Discriminating against a group of people (without the use of physical violence) is still violent.  Holding back money from the poor is also violent without being violent.  Christian pacifism isn't capable of these types of analyses because it reduces violence to physical violence.    Here's some fancy footwork that will probably bring me some angry orangereds.  If there nonviolent actions that are indeed violent, can't we also think of some things that go the other way? A nonviolent violence?  That is, an act of physical aggression that is nonviolent?  Violence is a technology of domination.  It is the flow of power enacted for the solidification and stratification of the social body.  Then, (another thesis) if there is a movement against this technology of domination it is essentially a nonviolent violence.  Physical aggression can certainly be an act of love: whether it's Jesus physically flipping over a table and whipping people or the proletariat flipping over the bourgeoisie, that is love for your neighbor.    This is a type of weak pacifism: not all physical aggression can be justified...in fact no physical aggression can be justified accept for energies directed toward liberation.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.4595434743

When they live together they are sleeping with one another and fulfilling every desire and when they do marry there is no sacredness anymore they‚Äôve already fornicated, had kids etc. in islam marriage is sacred and powerful it‚Äôs half our deen mashallah, in tough times and rough patches we beg Allah to shower his mercy upon us and help us, our basis on marriage is our worship to Allah we trust in him, we confide in him.

The prayer beads help you count the prayers and stay focused. * Ideally, you leave them in your pocket without wearing them at all. If you must wear them, they shouldn't be obviously displayed. * Furthermore, you shouldn't take the prayer beads into the bathroom or put them on the floor (directly).  The most common prayer is 'om mani padme hum.'","Hey u/Gutzo, I've actually answered a similar question before and here was my response:   ""Mala beads themselves are used as a tool of a prayer and meditation. People use them to chant in combination with a mantra. For example, I use them with ""Om mani pandme hum"", a mantra that I have found is quite powerful in my practice.  To be a little more concrete, take a look at your mala beads. There should be what is called a ""guru"" bead that has some sort of tassel or may just be larger. This bead is basically your starting and ending point. With the beads in hand, start at the guru bead and as you move the bead between your index and thumb, begin chanting your mantra on syllable at a time. So in the case of the mantra above it would go as such: Om- Ma- Ni - Pan- Me - Hum  With each bead, contemplate what each of the bits of the mantra mean. Go until you get back to the guru bead, turn the beads around, and go back around till you are again at the guru bead. Repeat as much as you wish. ""  So to sum up, it is a tool in meditation used by practitioners to bring their attention to a specific mantra and bring themselves deeper into their practice. These beads are unfamiliar to you, but they can be whatever you wish them to be for you. They are yours now and they don't have to be anything more than a reminder of Buddhism, peacefulness, joy or whatever you need them to be. They are material and are only as powerful as you want!

Modern social reformers, both Christian and secular, may on occasions still find it an ‚Äòoffense. ...   &nbsp;    >The truth must simply be accepted that the gospel of the N.T., in so far as it is a revolutionary social gospel, goes about reform in strange ways.  It attacks a social evil first from within.  This does not mean that the N.T. presents only an individualist program and ignores social concerns.  The N.T. is ‚Äòsocial‚Äô through and through.  It is ‚Äòcovenant‚Äô religion.   &nbsp;    >Kierkegaard, in one of his flashes of insight, describes this ‚Äòoffense‚Äô vividly.  The fact that Jesus himself had nothing apparently to do with politics must have appeared to his contemporaries as treason against his suffering nation.  His people were in earthly misery, their very existence was at stake.  Yet Jesus displays God‚Äôs kingdom as over against the earthly:   &nbsp;    >>‚ÄòThe contrast could not be more glaring.  In a happy land in time of peace the contrast between the eternal and the earthly is not so striking.  To say to a rich man, Thou shalt first seek God‚Äôs kingdom, is a mild thing, in contrast with this hard saying, this (humanly) shocking thing, of saying to a hungry man, Thou shalt first seek God‚Äôs kingdom.‚Äô   &nbsp;    >The paradox of the gospel, thus applied to social reform, is not always easy to grasp.  Nor does it necessarily rule out a Christian‚Äôs duty to employ other means in behalf of justice ‚Äì those of government power, for example.  Yet the paradox stands.  ... The success of Dickens as a social reformer rested, says Chesterton, upon ... the ... assertion, the N.T. beatitude, ‚ÄòBlessed are the poor.‚Äô   &nbsp;    >>‚ÄòHe described their happiness, and men rushed to remove their sorrow.  He described them as human, and men resented the insults to their humanity.‚Äô‚Äù (Wedel, 1953, *TIB* pp. vol.

[compare with] 1:21; Col. [Colossians] 1:16; 2:10; I Pet. 3:22).  To these are now added a third class ‚Äì **the world rulers of this present darkness**.  The title ‚Äòworld ruler‚Äô (Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑœâœÅ) [*kosmokrator*] is applied to a number of the savior-gods of antiquity ‚Äì Serapis, Isis, Mithras, Mercury, Zeus, and others.  Under this title the god appears to be identified with Helio, the sun; a sphere, representing the sun, is the symbol corresponding to this title (... Hombert ... 1946 ...).  The gods of the Roman Empire, then, are here regarded not as ‚Äòdumb idols‚Äô (I Cor. [Corinthians] 12:2), but as malignant spirits of great power. ... ‚Äòthis darkness‚Äô means simply the moral and intellectual climate of a pagan world ‚Äì ‚Äòthe realm of darkness‚Äô (Col. 1:13) which stands over against the kingdom of God, which is the realm of light (cf. 5:8).   &nbsp;    >**The spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places**: A comprehensive designation for all the classes of hostile spirits with whom the Christian must contend.  The language (as in 1:21; 3:10; and 4:10) clearly belongs to the contemporary astrology, which thinks of the heavenly bodies as the abodes of spirits which hold human life in thrall.‚Äù (Beare, 1953, *TIB* pp. vol.

[Thessalonians] 2:8-10; Rev. [Revelation] 16:12-16; 20:7-8; etc. [and so on]).  Such a meaning is, however, quite alien to the context as well as to the general thought of this writer; the Christian is here urged to arm himself for immediate battle, not for Armageddon.  We must suppose, then, either that the phrase is violently transposed from an eschatological setting into a new context to which it is not really relevant, or that it belongs to the vocabulary of the astrology which the writer is combating.  **The evil day** may then be taken to mean the time which the horoscope has designated as dangerous, when the ‚Äòunlucky star‚Äô is in the ascendant; and the Christian is taught not to face such a season in the spirit of helpless resignation which would possess the pagan victim of astrological lore, but to stand up and fight like a man.  It is not necessary to suppose that the writer takes horoscopes and astrology in general seriously; it is sufficient that he appreciates the paralyzing hold which such superstitions may still exercise over the minds of his readers, not wholly liberated from the influences of their pagan upbringing and environment.‚Äù (Beare, 1953, *TIB* pp. vol.

Please visit our [Wiki Starter Pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/wiki/starter_pack#wiki_i.27m_new_to_r.2Fhinduism.2C_where_do_i_start.3F) (specifically, our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/wiki/index#wiki_faq), which has some good answers for Qs like ""what is Hinduism"", ""is Hinduism monotheistic"", etc.)   We also recommend reading [What Is Hinduism](https://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/what-is-hinduism) (a free introductory text by Himalayan Academy) if you would like to know more about Hinduism and don't know where to start.  In terms of introductory Hindu Scriptures, we recommend first starting with the Itihasas ([The Ramayana](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRamayana/wiki/resources#wiki_recommended_texts), and [The Mahabharata](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMahabharata/wiki/resources#wiki_resources).) Contained within The Mahabharata is [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGita/wiki/resources), which is another good text to start with. Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas &amp; Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation.   In terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), there are many you can try and see what works for you such as r/Introspection, r/yoga, r/meditation or r/bhajan.

What is less hierarchical about it? Would anyone here be able to shed some light on it or point to a better explanation than the ones I have read?","I struggled with it, too. The [official comparison chart](http://www.pcusa.org/resource/comparison-chart-former-form-government-new-founda/) is hard to read. Also, lots of people see [hidden agendas](http://www.layman.org/news.aspx?article=28186) in it as well, so it is sometimes hard to trust all third party evaluations or comparisons.  When it was explained at our Presbytery meeting, one of the key elements was empowerment. The example I remember was about the kind of over-specification of committees and meetings at the Presbytery level which were required even when they didn't make sense for every Presbytery. For example, if you had to have a number of specific committees, but had few available members or difficultly getting a quorum, you'd spend most of the available time checking the box for meetings at the cost of other, perhaps more valuable kinds of service work.  The reduction of the specific requirements, coupled with a more open ended set of goals, would ostensibly allow Presbyteries to achieve the same ends with less pedantic meeting structures. The point of the change was to specify the important work to do, but not so much how to get it done.  I don't have any idea how well it is achieving those goals, but that was what I was told.","Simplified Version:  It's basically a reboot of the ""G"" section of the book of order. Year after year, the GA has been amending and reshaping a form of government that was put together in 1983 at reunion. The world has changed a lot since then, and so has the church. Every time a need for an exception rose in the Form of Government, an amendment was added. The result became a pretty complicated and tricky to navigate book of order, tricky enough that you have to take an exam on it to be ordained (and that exam wasn't all that easy).  Basically, a task force got together and looked at ways of starting over from scratch. For the most part, the NFOG does the same things the OFOG did, but with much softer language, and a little bit more breathing room.  For example: In the Old Form of Government, there was a prohibition on Associate Pastors moving up to the position of Senior Pastor in the same congregation. There was a way around this prohibition, but there were all kinds of hoops that had to be jumped through. Now with the NFOG, an associate pastor can become a senior pastor with a 75% vote of Presbytery (I think, I don't have a Book of Order with me).  Here is another: to be newly ordained, you used to have to have an installed position (in other words, you couldn't be ordained to a stated supply in a congregation... if you don't know what I mean by ""installed"" vs. ""supply"", let me know, I'll explain that too). As a result, many first time pastors have a hard time finding calls, because the smaller churches that would hire them can't afford installed pastors, but could afford stated supply pastors. The NFOG makes it much easier to get around that.  This is what the NFOG was aimed to do. There were some legitimate concerns about it: my presbytery, for example, voted it down. I think ultimately there are more good things about it than bad, and the bad will be improved upon as we move forward.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.1392843749

Some people's position may be based entirely on religion, and others' positions might have nothing to do with their religion. I imagine that most people think that violence in self-defense is justified, but I'm not sure that this particular view has anything to do with religion.   When do you think physical violence justified? Is there a difference between personal (e.g., a one-on-one situation) and large-scale conflicts (i.e., war)? Are your views on physical violence informed by your religion? And if so, please give some details. That is, what are the religious views and even specific sources that inform those views.  This might be a tricky topic, so please make extra efforts to keep the discussion open and civil (see the sidebar).","Physical violence in Islam is only justified in the context of self-defense on a personal or state level or as a punishment for crimes. If someone attacks me, I have the right to defend myself. In the context of an Islamic state, if we are driven from our homes or prevented from worshipping, we have the right to defend ourselves. This is based upon the fact that there were Muslims who were driven out of their homes and tortured in Mecca for practicing Islam.   In war, only combatants are to be attacked, never civilians, and property is not to be damaged, not even a tree.   I should note that none of this (except personally defending yourself) can be done without a Caliphate. The Muslims in Mecca never fought back. They only fought back when there was a Muslim state in Medinah.   Edit: I should mention that punishments can only be carried out in an Islamic state, by a judge or someone appointed by a judge, after acceptable proof has been provided. The examples we see of stoning people today is wrong. I have no idea how they justify that. The proof is practically impossible to provide, and there is no Islamic state.","One of the central texts in Hinduism is the Bhagavad Gita. It starts out with Arjuna, a warrior, standing on a battlefield. A great war is about to begin, and he draws his chariot between the two armies, to see who has come to fight. The war is an internecine conflict, so Arjuna has beloved family members and teachers on both sides, and he knows there is no way the war will end with all of his loved ones still living.   Arjuna tells his friend and chariot driver, Krishna, (who is God), that he doesn't want to engage in the battle. Arjuna says, ""I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness. Of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness, or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield... why should I wish to kill [these opponents], even though they might otherwise kill me?"" (Chapter 1, Verses 31-35)  Arjuna then makes an argument for pacifism. He says that it would be sinful to slay these kinsmen. Even though they may be overcome with greed and see no fault in killing one's family or quarreling with friends, that doesn't mean we should respond in the same way. If we do, it will result in the degradation of society, and no good can come of it. Arjuna decides that it would be better to be killed than to engage in this war. (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1, Verses 36-46).  Krishna convinces Arjuna to fight. One of his central arguments is that, as a warrior and a king, it is Arjuna's duty to defend his people against aggressors. Krishna also explains to Arjuna that an individual living entity is not killed when the body is killed - just like we remove yesterday's clothes and put on clean clothes for a new day, when this body is worn out and dies, we are born into a new body. So we should not lament so much for the loss of this body. And, whether we stay in this body, or die and move to another body, it is all determined by our karma.   **In summary**, there are two points from this: (1) Defense of yourself and others against aggressors is proper; (2) Death is not the great tragedy we tend to think it is.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.1549135898

Why have lights on the tree? Why throw coloured paint at each other? Sometimes there are vague reasons behind them but mostly they are forgotten. And also what is interesting is that atheists seem to be happy to go along with the holiday rituals - you would have thought they would object!  So why do we as human animals carry out these rites?

Why does it give us so much 'comfort' as a species to hear festive music for example (even if we hate it).

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/ExploreReligion.jsonl,ExploreReligion.jsonl,19rj0w,Self-Maintenance,"I have previously written a general [outline of self broken down into three stages](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreReligion/comments/19ggz2/the_ego_as_veil/c8o5gny) called [self-construction](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreReligion/comments/19ggz2/the_ego_as_veil/c8oc9jm), self-maintenance and self-enhancement.  I would like to take the opportunity to expand on self-maintenance process. I consider reflecting on self-maintenance processes as an integral aspect of my spirituality.  Self-maintenance processes are those processes which are geared towards maintenance of self-concept. Once people have constructed a self with specific contingent identities they will do things which serve to maintain those identities.   **Situational-Avoidance Strategies** Situational-avoidance strategies are strategies used to avoid situations which may bring about self-threat - threat to one's self-concept or identity. One way to accomplish this is to plan to go somewhere with low probability of self-threat. Someone who doesn't think they can dance would prefer to go to a pub over a dance club where they may be encouraged to dance. Someone who believes that 9/11 was an inside job may search the internet for ""9/11 was an inside job"" and avoid searching for ""9/11 conspiracy debunked"" or vice versa. This would produce results which confirm their thinking and avoid results which don't.  **Truth-Avoidance Strategies** Truth-avoidance strategies are those strategies which avoid addressing the truth when it is made obvious. For example shifting the goalposts - changing the subject. If the subject was the evolution of the human eye and a creationist found their position untenable due to lack of scientific knowledge they may reframe the debate in terms of anthropic coincidence to get away from an untenable position and maintain their identity.   **Introspection Illusion** It is often said by self-help gurus that if you want to know how you really feel about something you should go somewhere quiet and reflect on it. But we are very good at auto-suggestion. People will hold a thought in mind which biases their thinking towards confirmation or disconfirmation of the thought and makes introspection very biased. When people reflect on their over-all goodness after self-threat they overwhelmingly conclude they are good people.  **Splitting (Black and White Thinking)** In general its not just a concept which a person holds as true but an entire cognitive structure, a whole hierarchy of thought which provides the foundation for the concept. Usually there is some contrasting thought which is being denied. For example in reflecting on our goodness we are doing so in contrast of our potential for badness. I am good to the extent that I am not bad. This is black and white thinking or ""splitting"". If the truth lies outside of the hierarchy of thought it is easy enough to maintain the thought by maintaining the hierarchy and tossing all disconfirming stuff into the bad bin. I had a conversation earlier this week with a Catholic who began trying to convert me to Catholicism. I asked him if he's ever read the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching or the Qu'ran? He said ""No, but I already know they are false because the Bible is true."" That's a perfect mixture of splitting, truth-avoidance and confirmation bias, IMHO. He has avoided the fact that he hasn't been exposed to other views (truth-avoidance), while tossing everything into the bad bin (splitting) and only subjecting himself to confirming information (confirmation bias).  **Be A Pig - Rend the Speaker** Classically known as an ad hominem this strategy is aptly expressed in the Latin phrase *margaritas ante porcos* which means ""Pearls before swine"" and comes from the Bible (as far as I know). The strategy here is to attack the other person rather than address their points. I recently challenged some people on what I thought was a group-bias of sorts and they said ""Relax man. Take a chill pill."" This is a very subtle form of attacking the speaker by appealing to social norms of etiquette.  **Social Norms of Etiquette** I am running out of ideas to describe self-maintenance processes. I'm sure there are more ways we seek to maintain our self-concept through flocking with like-minded birds, and such, but one of the most striking things to me is that our social norms largely support our habits for delusional self-maintenance. I have tried not to say anything that could be interpreted as an offense. But due to the nature of this subject I can see that happening very easily. In most of my discussions with people they feel threatened by the very subject itself. I am frequently labeled *negative* and *overly critical* simply for discussing self processes in this light. The push of people at large is towards mutual self-maintenance and self-enhancement. They form pockets of like-minds and if you enter into one of those lion's dens and begin disagreeing with them it won't be long before they say start criticizing *you* instead of what you are saying.  Going out on a limb here because this is a good group of people generally. A couple of years ago a group of activists started an annual ""SlutWalk"" in Toronto in response to statements made by a Judge and a Police Officer. The statements were of the nature that women should be mindful of how they dress, and one of them included the word ""slut"". The purpose of the parade was to demonstrate that women *should* be *allowed* to dress however they want. People were outraged that law enforcement would say such things as ""women shouldn't dress like sluts"". I like to look into big controversies like this to see how they might have evolved from more innocent beginnings. One thing I found was that in Lee Ellis' *Handbook of Crime Correlates* and many other statistical criminology books state that there is a strong correlation between a female rape victim and her clothing. I also considered the possibility that the law officers were offering a *safety tip* and not a piece of *legislation*. Another example of this might be that it's illegal to enter onto someone's property without their consent (i.e. trespassing) but as a *safety tip* people should lock their doors if they don't want intruders.  My analysis of the ""SlutWalk"" event is that people who some kind of *identity* in the public discussion about rape, perhaps were rape victims themselves, were hypersensitive to discussion about the subject and misinterpreted the statements made by law-enforcement to be litigious in some way rather than being advice. I have also found that when I had entered into discussions with proponents of SlutWalk they didn't like my analysis very much and flat-out denied it's possibility. I'm not saying what actually happens to be the case it just seems like there is a preponderance of law enforcement saying this and getting raked over the coals. I believe one of them was demoted and the other lost their job. Moreover this *raking over the coals* is largely considered just deserts for the blasphemous claims.  **Conclusion** There are many strategies we employ to maintain our identities and shield them from criticism. Our identities are couched in emotions and there is generally emotional content involved in executing any of these strategies. I find it easier to identify the emotional flux than the specific strategies I use to distort reality and I understand those strategies the better I understand my motives. Although this may read like a criticism of ""people"", it's really something I try to look for in myself as part of my spirituality and I encourage others to think about this. It's also important for mental health IMHO. On closing I don't feel like I have done this subject justice and I'm wary of some of the examples I've used and the potential for disturbing the wondrous tranquility of this subreddit - which is always the case whenever I log in - but I have spent quite a lot of time on this and have things to do. So I apologize if I could have used more neutral examples, none of them were coming to me.  Cheers See also [Face](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_%28sociological_concept%29)","I think this on a social level, for example the SlutWalk thing, is expressed in the Rolling Stones' song *Sympathy for the Devil*:  **This part expresses the error of splitting**  *Just as every cop is a criminal*  *And all the sinners saints*  *As heads is tails*   **This part expresses that self-maintenance is a social phenomena**  *Just call me lucifer*  *Cause I'm in need of some restraint*  *So if you meet me*  *Have some courtesy*  *Have some sympathy, and some taste*  *Use all your well-learned politesse*  *Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah*   **The whole song implies a social phenomena, especially this part:**  *I shouted out,*  *Who killed the kennedys?*  *When after all*  *It was you and me*   **And this part:**  *I tell you one time, you're to blame*","I'm not at all knowledgeable when it comes to the school of philosophers known as the pragmatists (Pierce, James, Dewey etc.) but a lot of what you've said strikes me as similar to their ideas that beliefs are not to be understood as simply intellectual acceptance or rejection of propositions but habits of behaviour that have proven successful in action. It seems what we believe is our map of the world and this map is continually changing and adapting. For instance from my own experience, throughout my teenage years I was a Catholic and whenever I felt my convictions were under threat I would use a variety of the examples you've listed to cling on to the core beliefs. However as they became further strained it led to severe cognitive dissonance and only escalated what was already an existential crisis. I then became an atheist but the funny thing is, I fell into the exact same trap of selectively picking only the kinds of material that would so to speak boost my confidence in my own atheism and ultimately satisfy my ego. The more we can become aware of when we are falling into these traps the better as it helps create a more open dialogue where a variety of perspectives can be explored and evaluated.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.1018298414

Can someone please tell me where it says that in the writings and what exactly it says?,"And does this mean that things like drinking alcohol and sex before marriage instead of after marriage is something that is okay, as today in many places it‚Äôs the norm? Or does it mean it in different ways?",No. This is just a simplified description of Progressive Revelation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_revelation_(Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD).,"Regarding your question about the current laws, Baha‚Äôis look to the Most Holy Book revealed by Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah‚Äîin addition to His writings‚Äîto seek guidance on how to live a coherent life as desires by God. The quotes which helps us understand this are:      &gt;Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is the unerring balance established amongst men. In this most perfect balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed, while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own standard, did ye but know it.        &gt;The All-Knowing Physician hath His finger on the pulse of mankind. He perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom, the remedy. Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.    &gt;We can well perceive how the whole human race is encompassed with great, with incalculable afflictions. We see it languishing on its bed of sickness, sore-tried and disillusioned. They that are intoxicated by self-conceit have interposed themselves between it and the Divine and infallible Physician. Witness how they have entangled all men, themselves included, in the mesh of their devices. They can neither discover the cause of the disease, nor have they any knowledge of the remedy. They have conceived the straight to be crooked, and have imagined their friend an enemy.    &gt;Incline your ears to the sweet melody of this Prisoner. Arise, and lift up your voices, that haply they that are fast asleep may be awakened. Say: O ye who are as dead! The Hand of Divine bounty proffereth unto you the Water of Life. Hasten and drink your fill. Whoso hath been re-born in this Day, shall never die; whoso remaineth dead, shall never live.   Gleanings From the Writings of Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h, p.346     Some other quotes which refer to progressive revelation are:      &gt;Note thou carefully that in this world of being, all things must ever be made new. Look at the material world about thee, see how it hath now been renewed. The thoughts have changed, the ways of life have been revised, the sciences and arts show a new vigour, discoveries and inventions are new, perceptions are new. How then could such a vital power as religion‚Äîthe guarantor of mankind‚Äôs great advances, the very means of attaining everlasting life, the fosterer of infinite excellence, the light of both worlds‚Äînot be made new?   (‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√°, Selections from the Writings of ‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√°, p. 56)      &gt;Among the bounties of God is revelation. Hence revelation is progressive and continuous. It never ceases. It is necessary that the reality of Divinity with all its perfections and attributes should become resplendent in the human world. The reality of Divinity is like an endless ocean. Revelation may be likened to the rain. Can you imagine the cessation of rain? Ever on the face of the earth somewhere rain is pouring down.   Abdu‚Äôl-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 378.      &gt;Know of a certainty that in every Dispensation the light of Divine Revelation hath been vouchsafed to men in direct proportion to their spiritual capacity. Consider the sun. How feeble its rays the moment it appeareth above the horizon. How gradually its warmth and potency increase as it approacheth its zenith, enabling meanwhile all created things to adapt themselves to the growing intensity of its light.

I tried stopping countless times, but it always seems my urge for it overcomes me and I just go buy another one. God has taken most of my anger, impatience, pride, among other things but this one thing I can‚Äôt seem to shake because I know it‚Äôs something I just have to quit. Im only 19 and I work a full time outside job, and go to school so it‚Äôs hard work in the heat as well as mentally. I‚Äôve been doing great performance wise and it feels like the nicotine really helps me push through my day, but I know it‚Äôs probably better if I quit. Im really on the fence about what to do, my old one just ran out and I really wanna go buy another one, what do I do?  I really need some encouragement/advice","I was a pack a day smoker.  I understand the addiction. I was able to quit when I was pregnant.   Not something I recommend as a method for everyone.  Vaping is not healthy but it's better, and less expensive, than cigarettes.   I don't think it's a sin, but not smart either.  How about slowly reducing the amount of nicotine and increasing the time between using?",I would recommend you to try and quit it. It‚Äôs still damaging your body and in the long run could create you some problems. So try to stop using it and pray for help from the Lord.,comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.554226283

They are all California Mormons who sometimes display New Order Mormon views but remain faithful to and active in the LDS church.   From my limited understanding, I've mentioned to them that the Community of Christ might be more compatible with the spirituality they have talked about with me. I left the LDS church twenty years ago and feel it is psycho-emotionally pathological. I see my young nieces and nephews being taught what I was taught as a child and know the harm that can come of it.  How is the Community of Christ similar to or different than the Utah-based LDS church?","Perhaps exploring some of the links on this site can help you answer this question for yourself.  We share a 14 year common history with the LDS church.  Some people say we reflect the Kirtland Church, and the LDS church reflects the Nauvoo era church.  This of course is a bit simplistic, but it might be helpful.    For me, the biggest difference comes from our understanding of authority.  Community of Christ does not consider itself to be ""the one true church"".  We consider the proper role of the church to invite people into a relationship with Christ, but that the responsibility for that relationship and its nature belongs between each individual and Christ.    We don't think we have an exclusive claim on God.  Presiding Patriarch Elbert A. Smith in 1917 expressed an inclusiveness to God's work in the world that extended far beyond the confines of [Community of Christ] church.:  &gt;I have many forces at work in the world, saith the Lord. I have many spiritual forces at work that you know not of. You see but the smaller part of my work, and the world perceives it not at all.  As a non creedal church, our priesthood does not consider our role to be one of judging others for ""fitness"" or conformity of belief.  As servants of Christ, our work is for reconciliation of each one of us to Christ, and to each other.  We strive not to let disagreements be a barrier to accepting each other as faithful brothers and sisters in a spirit of love.","Thank you for the response. From what I've discussed with my siblings, the CoC sounds like a much better fit to their spiritual views. It's sad to see the fear the LDS church instills in its members about leaving is still such a force in their lives.  Thanks again.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.3223783352

The Gemara says what's proper for it, not what's not proper for it.  Lmitei mai, what does this exclude?  Rav Papa says: this excludes kamtzin, mincha offerings, that weren't put in a kli shares, a vessel that you put it into to prepare it for the Mizbeach.    Maskif loy Ravina, Ravina asks: What's the difference with how Ula rules?  Ula said: If Eimirim are put up on the Mizbeach before they sprinkle the blood, they don't take it off, because it's like food for the Mizbeach.  The Gemara explains: Eimirim aren't taken down from the Mizbeach because there's nothing missing.  The Kemitza, the mincha handful, is taken down because it's missing being put in a kli shares.    The Mishna said, R' Yehoshia says: Anything that's proper for the fire.  R' Gamliel learns this from the verse ola al mokdah, the burnt offering on the firewood.  He says: This means that if an ola flies off the Mizbeach, we put it back.  And from where does R' Yehoshia learn this?  Because it's written asher tochal haeish, what has fueled the fire belongs on the Mizbeach.  R' Gamliel says that this verse means that an ola is put back on the fire but ketores isn't.  R' Chanina bar Minyomi agrees.  R' Yehoshia says: it teaches both.  R' Gamliel said in our Mishna, Any Kodshim proper‚Ä¶ so how does R' Yehoshia explain ""Mizbeach""?  It tells us what is mekadesh that which is ruoy for the fire, that is, the Mizbeach is mekadesh.  R' Gamliel says, we learn that from kol hanogea bamizbeach yikdash.  R Yehoshia says that one verse teaches about Kodshim that were at one point ruoy and the other teaches about Kodshim that were never proper.  R Gamliel says that the Torah permits offering sacrifices that are pasul so there is no need to distinguish.  R' Shimon said in the Mishna, whether the korban is kosher...  The Mizbeach is mekadesh an ola.  An ola is offered because it's an ola.  The Mizbeach is mekadesh because it's the Mizbeach.  This excludes accompanying nesachim.  R' Yosi haglili says, maybe ""kol hanogea"" applies even when something isn't ruoy for the Mizbeach.  But we learn ""kevasim"", it's only mekadesh things that are ruoy, like kevasim, lambs.  R' Akiva says ""ola"" teaches that the Mizbeach is only mekadesh what's ruoy, like an ola.  What's the difference between these two views?  R' Ada bar Ahava says they differ regarding olas haof.  R' Akiva includes it from ola, and R' Yosi haglili excludes it from kevasim.  What does R' Yosi haglili learn from ""ola"", then?  If it only said kevasim, one might have thought that it is mekadesh animals that are still alive.  Ola teaches that they have to be sacrificed first.  What does R' Akiva learn from ""kevasim""?  If it only said ""ola"", maybe we would think it could be mekadesh menachos.  It says kevasim so we know it has to be an animal.  How do the tanaim differ from the Mishna?  Rav Papa says, the disagreement is regarding a kemitza that was put in a kli shares.  Reish Lakish says, the tanaim in the Mishna say that if it's by itself, we don't take it down.  The tanaim in the Beraisa say we take it down.","While I unfortunately have no useful input on this subject, I'd like to offer a snippet of what Google Translate pulled out of your submission:  &gt;Rav Ada bar forbidden love burnt chicken Binyehu Some say I was her superior, Mr. and Mr. Wellman was a sheep had imagined Compactors dictated spelling is not typographical sheep  Compators dictated spelling is not typographical sheep.

I struggle with the concept of forgiveness. I'm in counseling that says forgive yourself, and my church is telling me to forgive others. I can't do either of those things. I am at a place where I feel I am about to go mad if I see other people treating another person with respect and gentleness while I am madly furious at them with an intense need for justice. I don't want to reconcile, and I don't know how to handle the relationship in a public setting. I do not even want to acknowledge them. Family and friends have hurt me. I find it hard to believe in the goodness of God's creation as I have been duped far too many times by people, and I am still living out the consequences of others. It's hard to see that God is perfect when I haven't experienced it.       I carry a lot of pain with me that has turned into PTSD based on what others have done to me. I am traumatized by these experiences because my feelings weren't validated. I want to be validated with justice. I turn these feelings inward  The verse that God won't forgive you unless you forgive others has been giving me panic attacks. My priest says that God's mercy and forgiveness are unending. I still find that hard to believe, as that verse seems to contradict itself already with the idea that God's forgiveness is unending. I can't seem to find any answers to my problems. These problems have put a damper on me, trusting God with faith in his goodness. Can you suggest a new perspective?

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,PhilosophyofReligion.jsonl,q3hij2,A possible definition of omnipotence,"This is not really that though out, but just popped into mind like 5 min ago.   I have been thinking a bit about omnipotence recently, and how to best define it. You can of course define it as ""being able to do anything"", but that means being able to make a square circle, and to jrjgkfo a ergbfoo.  A more reasonable approach seems to be able to do anything logically possible. But God isn't able to sin. A way out of this, is to say, that it would be incoherent for a perfectly moral being to do something immoral. This might lead to the concept becoming meaningless, since it also seems contradictory for someone who can only run 20 km/h to run 500 km/h, thus making everything omnipotent.  Just writing this, I actually came up with this just now: You could define omnipotent as ""being able to do anything that is not necessarily contradictory"", since it is contingent that I can't run 500 km/h. It is, however, necessary that God is perfectly moral.  But that was not my original though. That was defining omnipotence as ""x is omnipotent IFF x is able to do anything logically possible, which x wants to do"". Here you can say, that God doesn't want to sin, and therefore remains omnipotent, but I might want to run 500km/h, but am unable to, and am thus not omnipotent.  This was probably really confused, and rushed. I should probably have thought about it some more, but I just wanted to write it down, and you became the victim. Hope to get some sparring.","It's so nice to have a mind where omni(potence)-things have a tendency to pop in for a mental visit. :)  First, I think the logic-limited omnipotence is a very workable approach and pretty sure you can find it floating around several mainstream approaches to God's Omniness. (sorry, English, I'll be gone shortly:)  Second, I would continue that line of thinking and wonder-ponder what does ""doing"" anything mean for something that is Omnipotent. What kind of boundaries are build around a Being that actively/passively/xxxxxly does anything at all? Would it be enough for G to be a ground-of-all-being-type-of-a-G to be(come) omnipotent. That is, whatever happens has God pushing it to happen from the deepest depths of being itself? Whatever happens will (maybe?) adhere to the logical possibility simply by virtue of being able to happen.  But also, does logical boundedness (if there is such a word/thing/state) require God to become part of being instead of its ground? I am pretty sure there is a price to pay if we ask God not to jrgkfo a ergbfoo - not because it would force God to do something that can't be done, but because it would force God out of its transcendence in order to not-do it.","I once heard an explanation of omnipotence which has been stuck with me since then. The issue, I think, is that we (Westerners) think of God as a supreme technocrat so our thinking about omnipotence is always somehow biased towards that attitude. We think of omnipotence as being able to turn our thoughts and imagination into reality.  So that another explanation would be one in which no thoughts are involved. For example, you are omnipotent in your body. You can do everything (move your arms and legs, grow your hair, beat your heart, ...) without thinking about it. Thinking about how it is done does not help you in any way. A physician who can describe the movement of muscles cannot move his arm any better than you. It is because you do not have to think about it, you just do it. In this way, omnipotent God may be something that is doing everything (all reality) without thinking about it.  &gt;A more reasonable approach seems to be able to do anything logically possible.  Please note that this kind of logic you are referring to has a limitation. It is linear, reality is not.  *edit: added more info*",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.9438645861

I definitely understand how you could have read it that way, but what I have in mind is something which might show us HOW one ought to proceed when doing theology and not necessarily WHAT specific beliefs one ought to come up with.  Would it make sense to provide the tools and various options available for undertaking any and all theology without providing the answers? Sure, i might make suggestions, but that's merely an acknowledgment of my own background and context which, I think, actually helps with clarity and transparency.  I'm not sure theos and logos actually directly translate to ""study of religious beliefs,"" but I guess that could work. If we're honest, we all have our own take, standpoint, perspective, what have you, on theology and its application to life. Very seldom will an individual's personal theological tendencies COMPLETELY overlap with another's.

If it's explained succinctly elsewhere, just link and downvote.  So from lurking here for a while, I get the impression the jumping-off point for most continental philosophy of religion nowadays is the rejection of the traditional theistic conception of God as a metaphysical entity (or of just the metaphysical proofs for God? Or of metaphysics in general?). What is the motivation for this? Where did it come from? What do I read if I want to know more about it?","This movement begins with Kant, who both critiqued the pretensions of metaphysics in general and set religion on the basis of moral rather than metaphysical arguments.  Jacobi, perhaps the most important early critic of Kant, in one sense radicalizes his critique by arguing that faith must be understood on its own grounds, rather than on Kant's moral theology.  The romantics, especially Schlegel, Schleiermacher, and Schelling, further elaborated this radicalization, arguing for a conception of religion which was artistic and pluralistic to the point of obscuring the distinction between theism and atheism.  Inspired by Hegel, the romantics, and the scientific treatment of religion, Feuerbach contributes a highly influential book which is essentially atheistic and identifies religion with our coming to know the essence of humanity.  Nietzsche further radicalizes this position, presenting a history of human development were we gradually free ourselves from the religious conception of humanity.  Heidegger takes up this line of thinking, arguing that questions of metaphysics must be distinguished from questions of theology in order to be understood, and vice-versa.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/DebateReligion.jsonl,DebateReligion.jsonl,22xarf,"what do you think about existentialists and their relation to reason, science, conceptual thinking?","here is what albert camus says in the myth of sisyphus:  &gt;Of whom and of what indeed can I say: ""I know that!"" This heart within me I can feel, and I judge that it exists. This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it exists. There ends all my knowledge, and the rest is construction. For if I try to seize this self of which I feel sure, if I try to define and to summarize it, it is nothing but water slipping through my fingers. I can sketch one by one all the aspects it is able to assume, all those likewise that have been attributed to it, this upbringing, this origin, this ardor or these silences, this nobility or this vileness. But aspects cannot be added up. This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me. Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will never be filled. Forever I shall be a stranger to myself. In psychology as in logic, there are truths but no truth. Socrates' ""Know thyself"" has as much value as the ""Be virtuous"" of our confessionals. They reveal a nostalgia at the same time as an ignorance. They are sterile exercises on great subjects. They are legiti mate only in precisely so far as they are approximate.  &gt; And here are trees and I know their gnarled surface, water and I feel its taste. These scents of grass and stars at night, certain evenings when the heart relaxes-how shall I negate this world whose power and strength I feel? Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. You describe it to me and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are true. You take apart its mechanism and my hope increases. At the final stage you teach me that this wondrous and multicolored universe can be reduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the electron. All this is good and I wait for you to continue. But you tell me of an invisible planetary system in which electrons gravitate around a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image. I realize then that you have been reduced to poetry: I shall never know. Have I the time to become indignant? You have already changed theories. So that science that was to teach me everything ends up in a hypothesis, that lucidity founders in metaphor, that uncertainty is resolved in a work of art. What need had I of so many efforts? The soft lines of these hills and the hand of evening on this troubled heart teach me much more. I have returned to my beginning. I realize that if through science I can seize phenomena and enumerate them, I cannot, for all that, apprehend the world. Were I to trace its entire relief with my finger, I should not know any more. And you give me the choice between a description that is sure but that teaches me nothing and hypotheses that claim to teach men but that are not sure. A stranger to myself and to the world, armed solely with a thought that negates itself as soon as it asserts, what is this condition in which I can have peace only by refusing to know and to live, in which the appetite for conquest bumps into walls that defy its assaults? To will is to stir up paradoxes. Everything is ordered in such a way as to bring into being that poisoned peace produced by thoughtlessness, lack of heart, or fatal renunciations.  &gt; Hence the intelligence, too, tells me in its way that this world is absurd. Its contrary, blind reason, may well claim that all is clear; I was waiting for proof and longing for it to be right. But despite so many pretentious centuries and over the heads of so many eloquent and persuasive men, I know that is false. On this plane, at least, there is no happiness if I cannot know. That universal reason, practical or ethical, that determinism, those categories that explain everything are enough to make a decent man laugh. They have nothing to do with the mind. They negate its profound truth, which is to be enchained. In this unintelligible and limited universe, man's fate henceforth assumes its meaning. A horde of irrationals has sprung up and surrounds him until his ultimate end. In his recovered and now studied lucidity, the feeling of the absurd becomes clear and definite. I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. For the moment it is all that links them together. It binds them one to the other as only hatred can weld two creatures together. This is all I can discern clearly in this measureless universe where my adventure takes place. Let us pause here. If I hold to be true that absurdity that determines my relationship with life, if I become thoroughly imbued with that sentiment that seizes me in face of the world's scenes, with that lucidity imposed on me by the pursuit of a science, I must sacrifice everything to these certainties and I must see them squarely to be able to maintain them. Above all, I must adapt my behavior to them and pursue them in all their consequences. I am speaking here of decency. But I want to know beforehand if thought can live in those deserts.  here is what nietzsche writes in the gay science:   &gt; How we, too, are still pious.‚ÄîIn science convictions have no rights of citizenship, as one says with good reason. Only when they decide to descend to the modesty of hypotheses, of a provisional experimental point of view, of a regulative fiction, they may be granted admission and even a certain value in the realm of knowledge‚Äîthough always with the restriction that they remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust.‚ÄîBut does this not mean, if you consider it more precisely, that a conviction may obtain admission to science only when it ceases to be a conviction? Would it not be the first step in the discipline of the scientific spirit that one would not permit oneself any more convictions?  &gt; Probably this is so; only we still have to ask: To make it possible for this discipline to begin, must there not be some prior conviction‚Äîeven one that is so commanding and unconditional that it sacrifices all other convictions to itself? We see that science also rests on a faith; there simply is no science ""without presuppositions."" The question whether truth is needed must not only have been affirmed in advance, but affirmed to such a degree that the principle, the faith, the conviction finds expression: ""Nothing is needed more than truth, and in relation to it everything else has only second-rate value.""  &gt; This unconditional will to truth‚Äîwhat is it? Is it the will not to allow oneself to be deceived? Or is it the will not to deceive? For the will to truth could be interpreted in the second way, too‚Äîif only the special case ""I do not want to deceive myself"" is subsumed under the generalization ""I do not want to deceive."" But why not deceive? But why not allow oneself to be deceived?  &gt; Note that the reasons for the former principle belong to an altogether different realm from those for the second. One does not want to allow oneself to be deceived because one assumes it is harmful, dangerous, calamitous to be deceived. In this sense, science would be a long-range prudence, a caution, a utility; but one could object in all fairness: How is that? Is wanting not to allow oneself to be deceived really less harmful, less langerous, less calamitous? What do you know in advance of the character of existence to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of the unconditional mistrust or of the unconditionally trusting? But if both should be required, much trust as well as much mistrust, from where would science then be permitted to take its unconditional faith or conviction on which it rests, that truth is more important than any other thing, including every other conviction? Precisely this conviction could never have come into being if both tuth and untruth constantly proved to be useful which is the case. Thus‚Äîthe faith in science, which after all exists undeniably, cannot owe its origin to such a calculus of utility; it must have originated in spite of the fact that the disutility and dangerousness of ""the will to truth,"" of ""truth at any price"" is proved to it constantly. ""At any price ': how well we understand these words once we have offered and slaughtered one faith after another on this altar!  &gt; Consequently, ""will to truth"" does not mean ""I will not allow myself to be deceived"" but‚Äîthere is no alternative‚Äî""I will not deceive, not even myself""; and with that we stand on moral ground. For you only have to ask yourself carefully, ""Why do you not want to deceive?"" especially if it should seem‚Äîand it does seem!‚Äîas if life aimed at semblance, meaning error, deception, simulation, delusion, self-delusion, and when the great sweep of life has actually always shown itself to be on the side of the most unscrupulous polytropoi. Charitably interpreted, such a resolve might perhaps be a quixotism, a minor slightly mad enthusiasm; but it might also be something more serious, namely, a principle that is hostile to life and destructive.‚Äî""Will to truth""‚Äîthat might be a concealed will to death.  &gt; Thus the question ""Why science?"" leads back to the moral problem: Why have morality at all when life, nature, and history are ""not moral""? No doubt, those who are truthful in that audacious and ultimate sense that is presupposed by the faith in science thus affirm another world than the world of life, nature, and history; and insofar as they affirm this ""other world""‚Äîlook, must they not by the same token negate its counterpart, this world, our world?‚ÄîBut you will have gathered what I am driving at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith upon which our faith in science rests‚Äîthat even we seekers after knowledge today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take our fire, too, from the flame lit by a faith that is thousands of years old, that Christian faith which was also the faith of Plato, that God is the truth, that truth is divine.‚ÄîBut what if this should become more and more incredible, if nothing should prove to be divine any more unless it were error, blindness, the lie‚Äîif God himself should prove to be our most enduring lie?‚Äî  examples could be multiplied from people said to be existentialists. whether they are in fact existentialists or deserve to be called as such is a good question. camus pointedly rejected the label.  themes that i see in common are a general distrust of the idea that reason, science and conceptual thinking will do the things that people want, claim or need them to do. and that these can be downright unhealthy. it's not just about the ways they're put to use, but also what the uses they get put to, demonstrate about the people themselves. nietzsche for example offers a genealogical and psychological account of the faith in science that we have.  what do you think about this?  personally i think it is a compelling criticism of an attitude and way of thinking i see so often here, not only by atheists but also by theists. it's a truly human problem.","I think its hard to generalize existentialism because of how diverse the field is, but I would say my problem with it, in general, is that it relies upon us as a starting point. Our brains are not designed to comprehend things like the existence of the universe, or the science behind it. That is why things that seem intuitively obvious are often completely wrong whilst things that seem ridiculous to the highest degree are in fact true. An example would be the fact that the sum of all natural numbers, to infinity, is -1/12. That's incredibly hard to believe and sounds completely ridiculous, and yet its very important in many fields of physics.   The reason I find science to be convincing is because it has reached a point of critical thinking that is hard for most to achieve. To accept that we could be wrong, and everything we think we know could be wrong, demonstrates the pinnacle of critical thinking. To think that we, innately, have all the answers and all the truth demonstrates the pinnacle of arrogance.","&gt; An example would be the fact that the sum of all natural numbers, to infinity, is -1/12. That's incredibly hard to believe and sounds completely ridiculous, and yet its very important in many fields of physics.  This is by no means my area of expertise, but the usually spoken of sum, does not produce the result you claimed. And that is the one people are thinking of and which is intuitive when you say ""the sum of all natural numbers"".  In essence, as far as I can see, all of the ""incredibly hard to believe"" side, comes solely because you expressed the issue poorly.

When the apostle had determined to take him with him, he found it necessary to have him circumcised not from any supposition that circumcision was necessary to salvation; but because of the Jews, who would neither have heard him nor the apostle, had not this been done‚Ä¶   &nbsp;     In Thessalonica they were opposed by the unbelieving Jews, and obliged to flee to Ber√¶a, whither the Jews from Thessalonica followed them.  To elude their rage, Paul, who was most obnoxious to them, departed from Ber√¶a by night, to go to Athens, leaving Silas and Timothy at Ber√¶a.  ‚Ä¶ After that Paul preached at Athens but with so little success, that he judged it proper to leave Athens, and go forward to Corinth, where Silas and Timothy came to him‚Ä¶ and when he left Corinth they accompanied him, first to Ephesus, then to Jerusalem, and after that to Antioch, in Syria.  Having spent some time in Antioch, Paul set out with Timothy on his third apostolical journey; in which, after visiting all the churches of Galatia and Phrygia, in the order in which they had been planted, they came to Ephesus the second time, and there abode for a considerable time.  In short from the time Timothy first joined the apostle, as his assistant, he never left him, except when sent by him on some special errand.‚Äù  (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. II 550)   &nbsp;    **If**, however, I Timothy is post Paul, then Timothy represents all the ""Timothies‚Äù of the church whom the writer is exhorting to preserve Pauline Christianity against incipient heresies.   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúThe Pastorals are distinguished from all other New Testament letters in that they are addressed ... to a special functional class within the church, namely, the professional ministry. Thus these letters occupy the unique distinction of being not simply the only letters in the New Testament to be addressed primarily to clergymen, but also of being in this sense the first extant pastoral letters - that is, letters written by a pastor to pastors - in the history of the church.‚Äù  (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* p. XI 344)   &nbsp;    ‚Äú[*The Interpreter's Bible*‚Äôs] study is ‚Äúfrankly based on the theory that the Pastorals [1st and 2nd Timothy, and Titus], in large part at least, are pseudonymous; that they belong to a later generation than Paul; and that in the main they are to be explained out of the historical context of the first half of the second century.‚Äù  (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* pp. XI 343-344)   &nbsp;    ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the pastorals are best understood against the background of the second century, the evidence in the letters relative to church order ... clearly reflect a time when apostle and prophet have been succeeded by bishop (and archbishop?) and/or elder in a stabilized church organization fully committed to an authorized succession of ordained ministers.  The local churches are no longer lay churches, nor are their needs now taken care of simply by itinerant missionaries.  There is obviously hierarchical organization both in the local and ecumenical church.  The chief function of the bishop (or archbishop?) is to transmit and maintain the true faith.‚Äù  (Gealy, 1953,*TIB* p. XI 344)   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúThe problem of church orders in the Pastorals cannot be dismissed without some consideration of the situation in the letters of Ignatius of Antioch, seven letters written on the way from Syria to martyrdom in Rome, A.D. 110-17, one each to five churches in Asia ‚Äì Ephesus, Magnesia, Tralles, Philadelphia, Smyrna ‚Äì one to Rome, and one to Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna.  The church as reflected in these letters, both as regards doctrine and organization, seems already fully ‚Äòcatholic.‚Äô  Indeed, the phrase ‚Äòthe Catholic Church‚Äô first appears here.  The primacy of the Roman church is recognized.  The hierarchy of bishops, priests, and deacons is again and again insisted upon.  Indeed, the organization of the church seems so finally established as to make the descriptions in the Pastorals seem primitive by way of contrast, and even to require a dating much earlier than 110.   &nbsp;    That the differences between the Pastorals and the Ignatian letters are great and important, and that the Ignatian letters from the standpoint of church orders constitute a formidable objection to dating the Pastorals as late as 150, must be admitted. ‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    Kirsopp Lake (*Journal of Biblical Literature*, LVI [1937]) ‚Ä¶ continued to believe that the journey-to-martyrdom framework of the Ignatian letters is not convincing, and that they are therefore spurious.  If this should be so, of course they would present no problem for a late dating of the Pastorals.   &nbsp;    No entirely satisfactory solution of this problem is yet available.  The most attractive suggestion has been made by Walter Bauer (*Rechtl√§ubigkeit und Ketyerei im √§ltesten Christentum* [*Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity*] T√ºbingen: J.C. B. Mohr, 1934).  It is his thesis that as a result of the triumph of ‚Äòorthodoxy‚Äô over ‚Äòheresy,‚Äô extant early Christian writings *(a)* conceal the real strength of heretical movements in the various areas of the ancient church, and *(b)* represent the orthodox patterns of faith and order as both older and more widespread than they actually were.  Therefore Bauer asserts that contrary to the impression crated by Ignatius, in his time Syria and west Asia Minor cannot be supposed to have had a monarchical episcopate.  The real fact that is concealed behind Ignatius‚Äôs constant insistence on Episcopal claims is that he is the frantic leader of a minority group in intense struggle with a determined majority stubbornly refusing obedience to him‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    As is generally the case when a minority group is at its wits‚Äô end, in desperation it puts forward the man of power with determination to dictate.  If, then, Ignatius can effectively assert the claim of authority of one bishop, himself that bishop in Antioch, he might well hope by a Herculean effort climaxed in martyrdom to turn his minority into a majority, and to establish as orthodoxy the faith and order championed by himself.‚Äù  (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* p. XI 347)   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúPaul‚Äôs reputation for misanthropy may be largely the fault of Pseudo Paul: professional opportunities for women in the church have got out of hand and should be very much restricted.  The freedom granted them in the apostolic age to exercise the gifts of the Spirit, even Paul's insistence that in Christ there is neither male nor female, had brought them into quick and widespread public activity.  This will not do at all, the writer urges.  Since ‚Äòthe woman‚Äô (Eve including her daughters) was deceived and became a transgressor,‚Äô she is permanently disqualified as a public teacher and must be given no authority over men (I Tim. [Timothy] 2:12-14).  As ‚Äòweak‚Äô (II Tim. 3:6), women are easily captured by glib heretical propagandists; and in any case, they talk too much (I Tim. 5:13).  So far as public professional work for women is concerned, it must be limited to the order of ‚Äòwidows.‚Äô  And the rules, here the author insists, must be revised and rigorously applied to limit the numbers as far as possible.""  (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* p. XI 349)   &nbsp;    ‚Äú‚ÄòTimothy‚Äô is charged with liturgical functions.  He is to be responsible for public worship, both in form and content.  Of special importance in the public prayers is that ‚Äòall men,‚Äô including ‚Äòkings and all who are in high positions,‚Äô be prayed for (I Tim. 2:1-2).  The prayer position advocated is ‚Äòlifting holy hands‚Äô (I Tim. 2:8), that is, sanding with hands uplifted, palms turned upward.  Particular emphasis is laid on the rule that only men shall be allowed to participate in the public prayers, or in teaching or conduct of public worship.  Women shall by no means lead in prayer ‚Ä¶ They may attend public worship, but inconspicuously and in silence.‚Äù (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* p. XI 350)   &nbsp;    ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the author‚Äôs one concern is to purge the church of what he is sure is alien, un-Pauline, and therefore unchristian belief and practice.   &nbsp;    In the intensity of his opposition the author flings an accumulated heap of epithets at his opponents, denouncing them with scathing and scorching language. ‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    >‚ÄòLovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, inhuman, implacable, slanderers, profligates, fierce, haters of good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding the form of religion but denying the power of it‚Äô (II Tim. 3:2-5).‚Äù (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* pp. XI 350-351)   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúIn the Pastorals the author is determined to define and consolidate the faith and order of the church as over against, on the one hand, certain lingering and tenacious Jewish practices which Jesus, and particularly Paul, had rejected, and on the other, against a variety of religious ideas which may be broadly termed Hellenistic ‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    The problem of Christianity as the heir of Hebrew‚ÄìJewish faith and culture was how to release the prophetic, ethical element of Judaism from that complex of accumulated ideas and practices which confined its effective functioning to an ethnic group‚Ä¶  Christianity, under one aspect, was Judaism transplanted to and sustained by a Hellenistic soil.  As a Jewish heresy, Christianity never thrived on Jewish soil; transplanted to Hellenistic soil, however, it flourished so luxuriantly in the new climate that it seemed at times to have wholly lost its Jewish identity and to be completely transformed by its new environment into a wholly Hellenistic thing.   &nbsp;    Even after the membership of the church had become predominantly Gentile, even after the break between synagogue and church had become irreconcilable, the pressures of Judaism continued to exert themselves upon the church, particularly through the medium of the Old Testament scriptures.  As the new Israel, as the heir to the promises, the church as a matter of course (notwithstanding Marcion) retained the Jewish scriptures.‚Äù  (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* p. XI 351)   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúEven though it may be admitted that at least some heretical teachers sought to ground their ‚Äòmyths‚Äô and ‚Äògenealogies‚Äô in the revealed scriptures, the ‚Äòlaw,‚Äô thus giving a Jewish tinge to the heresies, nevertheless the content of the myths was not really Jewish, but Greek-Oriental-Gnostic^1 .  The essential context within which alone the meager descriptions of the heresies combated in the Pastorals and the concerns of the writer can be adequately interpreted is the complex, confused, yet pervasive and fascinating Gnostic movement of the second century. ‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    A turbid and turbulent stream, its confused waters poured out of Asia into the Roman Empire during the first two centuries of the Christian Era, mingling Oriental dualism with Hellenistic world weariness and ‚Äòloss of nerve,‚Äô offering men both a rational explanation of a God wholly good and a world wholly evil, and a salvation (for certain select persons) from the finite world of matter, change, evil, ignorance, and sin, effected by means of a mystical rebirth into the higher world. ‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    Gnostic Christianity *might have become orthodox Christianity* had it been able to prevail over the Catholic system ‚Äì that is, had it not moved too quickly and too far from the Jewish element in Christianity, had it been able to persuade the church to exchange its philosophically na√Øve Jewish prophetic ancestry for the involved, abstruse, even occult Hellenistic metaphysics congenial to the age.‚Äù  (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* p. XI 355)   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúAll ‚Ä¶ attempts to elaborate an angelic hierarchy of mediators, aeons, or emanations, as intermediate causes, are nonsense to the author of the Pastorals, to whom the Gnostic putting of the problem is basically false.  Since for him God created the world, evil is not a cosmological problem but a moral one.  The creator God is therefore not a morally inferior God, and the need for any series of protective emanations vanishes.   &nbsp;    Since to the author of the pastorals God the Creator is also God the Savior, the Gnostic theory and scheme of salvation is rejected at four points: *(a)* there are not two gods‚Ä¶ *(b)* Salvation is not effected by ‚Äòknowledge,‚Äô that is, supernatural or mystical illumination, but by faith and obedience.  Most characteristically, ‚ÄúChristianity in the Pastorals is described as (the) faith, not as knowledge (*gnosis*), and Christians as believers not ‚Äòknowers.‚Äô  Hence also the persistent emphasis on good works.  *(c)* Insistence that ‚ÄòGod our Savior ‚Ä¶ desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of truth‚Äô ‚Ä¶ seems to be a direct repudiation of the Gnostic classification of men into the three types, only one of which is capable of salvation. ‚Ä¶ And *(d)* a Docetic Christology is unnecessary and impossible.   &nbsp;    Further, the Pastorals reject the Gnostic interpretation, disparagement, or rejection of the Old Testament‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    Likewise, the writer rejects at least the most radical Gnostic modification of early Christian eschatology [the science of last things].  To hold that ‚Äòthe resurrection is past already‚Äô is to ‚Äòhave swerved from the truth‚Äô‚Ä¶ And although the author and the second-century church themselves had necessarily to make some adjustments as to the ‚Äòtime of his coming,‚Äô nevertheless they still believed that the Lord would come.   &nbsp;    Are there also evidences that antinomian or libertarian trends were present among the heretics?  It has been urged that such is the case, *(a)* on the ground of the vice lists‚Ä¶; *(b)* it is contended that the author‚Äôs determined attempt to put women in their place..., to keep slaves submissive ‚Ä¶, even his concern that the clergy exemplify model behavior ‚Ä¶, are to be taken as evidence that the heretics were promoting a feminist, slave, layman‚Äôs movement in insubordination to the established hierarchy of the church.‚Äù   (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* p. XI 357)   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúFrom the time of F.C. Baur (1835) on, it has been from time to time vigorously maintained that it was the Marcionite schism which evoked the Pastorals.  If such could be shown to be probable, the pseudonymity of the letters would be proved and a date not far from 150 assured‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    *(a)* Marcion was the most interesting and important heretic of the second century.  Sincere and determined, he was an incisive dialectician, the tireless advocate of a clear and challenging interpretation of Christianity which, it could plausibly be urged, had every right to claim to be the only authentic form of the faith.  Also an able organizer, Marcion was the most versatile, the most enterprising, the most planful, and therefore the most annoying and dangerous heretic in the second century ... ‚Äòno other single man had called forth such a volume of anxious apologetic from the Church.‚Äô [Blackman]‚Ä¶ he joined the church at Rome, sought favor by a large gift of money, and urged his case.  Nevertheless, both he and his theories were rejected, probably in 144.  The rest of his life he spent in establishing and promoting the Marcionite church, the first truly schismatic church of importance, it would seem, in Christian history.    ‚Ä¶    *(c)* Marcion‚Äôs basic assumptions appear to have been (i) an essential dualism according to which the created world is inherently evil; (ii) Christianity, given adequate expression by Paul alone, should be clearly, decisively, and dramatically separated, as *sui generis* [unique], both from Judaism and from Hellenistic-Gnostic-Christian sects of any sort.  If Marcion refused to countenance the speculative technique of the Greek philosophers of religion, he likewise refused to allegorize the Old Testament.  The only alternative left to him was to reject the Old Testament ‚Äì indeed, all portions of the ‚ÄòNew Testament‚Äô also which seemed to him to ‚ÄòJudaize.‚Äô ‚Ä¶  Marcion‚Äôs dualism further expressed itself in two ways: (i) rejection of belief in the resurrection‚Ä¶, and Docetic Christology with abandonment of belief in the return of Christ; and (ii) asceticism.   &nbsp;    >‚ÄòWe know of no Christian community in the second century which insisted so strictly on renunciation of the world as the Marcionites‚Ä¶ Those who were married had to separate ere they could be received baptism into the community.  The sternest precepts were laid down in the matter of food and drink.  Martyrdom was enjoined.‚Äô [Harnack]   &nbsp;    If Marcion rejected Paul‚Äôs scripture as a consequence of consistently carrying through Paul‚Äôs doctrine of justification by faith, the writer of the Pastorals was here loyal to Paul‚Äôs practice, although not to Paul‚Äôs theory as sharpened by Marcion.  He did not reject the ‚Äòlaw‚Äô for the ‚Äògospel‚Äô as Marcion did.  Rather he gave it a permanent if subordinate place, thereby weakening the Pauline principle but conserving the values of an ancient tradition.‚Äù (Gealy, *TIB* 1953, pp. XI 358-359)   &nbsp;    If ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the author of the Pastorals is seen as a separate individual, and not as a depleted or altered Paul, he assumes a new position of importance in the New Testament and in the history of the ancient church.  The New Testament thereby becomes enriched with an important type of personality distinct and different from any of the other great figures delineated therein, a type without which the origin of the catholic church is inexplicable.‚Äù  (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* pp. XI 363-364)   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúThe writer accepts the (Pauline) Christian faith as the Jew accepts torah and insists that it shall be as rigorously obeyed.   &nbsp;    Likewise, in his attitude toward women he holds an essentially Jewish point of view‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    The attitude of the author toward the Scriptures is basically the same as that of Paul and Jesus: on the one hand, it insists on their adequacy and finality; on the other, it radically reinterprets them, on occasion even to the point where reinterpretation actually means rejection.   &nbsp;    Quite in accord with [his] concern for orthodoxy in faith and order are the regularization and virtual disappearance of the Spirit, which is now regarded not as a creative power but as a conservative one (II Tim. 1:14).  The Spirit does not now manifest itself spontaneously and unpredictably: it is conferred by a rite, the laying on of hands‚Ä¶ The most striking difference between the Pastorals and the Paulines ‚Ä¶ is that whereas Paul is profoundly mystical, the writer of the Pastorals is rigorously ecclesiastical.   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúIn attempting to appraise the importance of ‚ÄòPaul‚Äô in his time, it may be said quite frankly that in the New Testament, after Jesus, there are but two great and seminal minds who were able to translate one religious tradition (Judaism) into another (Hellenism) in such a way as to create a genuinely new religion (Christianity) ‚Äì Paul and the author of the Fourth Gospel‚Ä¶. In contrast to these two giants, the author of the Pastorals, and indeed most other later New Testament writers, seem without originality ‚Äì sincere and devoted, it is true, but without fresh ideas ‚Ä¶ .   &nbsp;    That the author is intellectually unadventurous is obvious on every page:   &nbsp;    >‚ÄòMorally bold and vigorous, it was still intellectually timid or weak; and, victorious as a way of life, it was still philosophically deficient.‚Äô Charles Cochrane 1940   &nbsp;    The times called for orthodoxy, not for inspiration ‚Ä¶ The demand at the moment was for rules in black and white.  Naturally this meant a return to ‚Äòlaw‚Äô ‚Äì even, if you will, to ‚Äòlegalism‚Äô.‚Äù (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* pp. XI 365-374)   &nbsp;   FOOTNOTES   &nbsp;   ^1 ‚ÄúThe main concerns of Gnosticism may be briefly outlined: *(a)* Both religiously and philosophically all forms of Gnosticism are rooted in dualism.  The basic assumption is that God as Spirit is wholly good, the world as matter wholly evil.  God is thus radically separated from the world, which, because it is in essence evil, cannot have been created by him.  Both the transcendence and perfection of God are protected by a theory which accounts for the world as the end product of a series of emanations (called aeons), generally thought of in pairs, male and female.  As manifestations of the transcendent God these aeons constitute the pleroma [the totality of divine powers], the ‚Äòfullness‚Äô of God.  Eventually, as a result of progressive degeneration, one of them (sometimes called Sophia) ‚Äòfell,‚Äô dragging a fragment of spirit into matter and thereby calling the world into being, either with or without the aid of an inferior creator god, a Demiurge [created creator], now identified with the God of the Old Testament, now less concretely with angels or ‚Äòrulers‚Äô (Œ±œÅœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ) [*arkhontes*].   &nbsp;    *(b)* Salvation is thought of as the release of the spirit from its prison house of flesh and restoration to its heavenly sphere.  Since the spirit in man has been contaminated by its lodgment in mater, salvation can be effected only by a savior sent from the aeon world.  As a heavenly aeon, Christ could not really touch matter.  Hence Gnostic Christology was commonly Docetic ‚Äì that is, Christ only seemed to have a body.   &nbsp;      Not all men are thought of as capable of salvation, however.  Rather, there are three groups: the œÖŒªŒπŒ∫ŒøŒπ [*ulikoi*] the ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô persons, who are hopeless; the œàœÖœáŒπŒ∫ŒøŒπ [*psukhikoi*], the ‚Äòpsychical‚Äô, who may expect a moderate salvation; and the œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒøŒπ [*pneumatikoi*], the ‚Äòspiritual,‚Äô who are by nature so constituted as to be capable of receiving the full saving knowledge which will entitle them at death to rise into the pleroma to take their place among the planetary powers.   &nbsp;    *(c)* Logically, then, the Old Testament with its creator God was regarded as the revelation of a lower divine being. ‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    *(d)* Since only spirit, ‚Äòlight-stuff,‚Äô is capable of ascending into the heavenlies, or of union with god, since the flesh as matter is inherently evil, a radical revision of early Christian eschatology is called for.  The very idea of the resurrection of the flesh becomes abhorrent.  Since the ‚Äòknower,‚Äô the illuminated is already immortal, he awaits only separation from the body.  There is really no need for any parousia or second coming of Christ or for a future general resurrection and last Judgment.  At the time of death the soul rises into the pleroma among the planetary powers in heaven.   &nbsp;  *(e)* Gnostic ethic was logically inclined to asceticism.  Since the material world was evil the saved man should shun it as far as possible.  Hence marriage as creating new bodies was avoided; so also the more ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô foods such as meat and wine.  However, antinomianism or libertarianism was also congenial to the Gnostic way of thinking.  Since salvation was thought of as cosmological rather than moral, the ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô man might think of redeemed spirit as quite unaffected by anything the flesh did, and thus give free rein to physical impulses. ‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    ‚ÄúThe probabilities are great that the dominant emphases in the letters, together with the terminology in which the Christian faith is set forth, were to a considerable degree determined by way of reaction to the Gnostic conglomerate.‚Äù (Gealy, 1953, *TIB* pp. XI 355-356)   &nbsp;   [An Amateur's Journey Through the Bible](https://bikingfencer.blogspot.com/2012/03/first-timothy.html)",I just found this community and looked over some of your studies.

The premises rely on nothing tangible per se, but rather on logical inferences stemming from the conclusions necessary, in relation to the initial premises and how they relate to real world observations. The philosophy of religion attempts to keep all of this in a cohesive worldview that can remain logically sound. Whether you believe the initial premises or not can be taken into consideration in a logical analysis of religion, but shouldn't effect your overall conclusions and inferences if you wish to remain objective. While transcendental ideas cannot be objectively observed, for instance, they can be subjectively experienced and have been recorded throughout time as such. Modern psychology can account for a lot as far as experience is concerned, but is still based on a set of initial premises that cannot necessarily account for experience itself.

These at last issued in their captivity: the inhabitants of the former country being carried away by the Assyrians, and those of the latter by the Chaldeans.  The former never recovered their ancient territories; and were so disposed of by their enemies, that they either became amalgamated with the heathen nations, so as to be utterly undistinguishable, or they were transported to some foreign and recluse place of settlement, that the place of their existence, though repeatedly guessed at, has, for more than *two thousand years*, been totally unknown.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;In mercy to the less polluted inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah, though delivered up into the hands of their enemies, God had promised, by his prophet, that at the expiration of *seventy years* they should be enlarged, and restored to their own country.  This prediction was most literally fulfilled; and the books of *Ezra*, *Esther*, and *Nehemiah*, inform us *how* the divine goodness accomplished this most gracious design, and the *movers* and *agents* whom he employed on the occasion. (Clarke, 1831, p. II 606)   &amp;nbsp;    Robert North, S.J., The Chronicler: 1-2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, in *The New Jerome Biblical Commentary*, 1990   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The last books of the Hebr. [Hebrew] Bible are called ‚ÄúAnnals‚Äù (*dibr√™ yƒÅm»ãm* [‚Äúwords of days‚Äù]), i.e.[in other words], Chronicles‚Ä¶ Chronicles is by our standards a book of history.  Partly it is a dull, dry listing of genealogies, partly a collection of lively sermons‚Ä¶ Why was this *third* history written, after the deuteronomistic history (Josh [Joshua] ‚Äì Kgs [Kings]) and the final redaction of the Pentateuch? ‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The principal block of Chr [Chronicles] sets forth the achievement of David, chiefly the regulation of the Temple cult, narrated in 323 verses (as against only 77 in Samuel, and 73 in Chr on David‚Äôs military or civil activities).  Both David‚Äôs rise to power in displacing Saul and the melancholy saga of succession to David‚Äôs throne are omitted.  In exchange, the emergence of David is introduced chiefly by lengthy genealogies: his own‚Ä¶ the Chronicler‚Äôs Levite clan‚Ä¶a skeletal history of the human race from Adam to Saul‚Ä¶ Thus, from a surface look we may say that Chr was written to glorify and consolidate the ritual and dynastic authority of the Davidic covenant, almost wholly ignoring the covenant of Moses and Sinai so largely focused elsewhere in the Bible‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Since JBC [the *Jerome Biblical Commentary*] there has arisen a forceful opposition to the notion of ‚Äúa Chronicler including Ezra.‚Äù  Hence, in this NJBC [the *New Jerome Biblical Commentary*] we will not longer simply presume such a unity, which in 1968 was almost unanimously agreed. ‚ÄúThe Chronicler‚Äôs work may include Ezra, but to delineate ‚Äòhis‚Äô theology [or his aim, or his sources] it is better to treat them apart‚Äù (M. Saebo‚Ä¶).  Where we utilize below the word ‚ÄúChronicler‚Äù it will be in reference to the hypothesis that his work included also the Ezra books.  But wherever possible we will use the term ‚ÄúChronicles‚Äù to refer to that work without presuppositions. Yet even the recent antagonists of such a ‚ÄúChronicler‚Äù admit that we cannot evaluate the aim and authorship of either work without taking into account the arguments for and against the coalescence with Ezra. (North, 1990, pp. 362-363)   &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;Today‚Äôs Jewish people rather tenderly favor the expression ‚ÄúSecond Temple.‚Äù  It is a chronological term for an important period of their ethnic existence.  That era after the return from exile and until the Diaspora is in a certain sense continuing today.  But the century which culminated in the destruction of the Temple (AD 70) fostered the three most controversial phenomena of all Jewish history: the baptizing sectaries of Qumran and elsewhere; Hillel and Shammai; Jesus and Paul.  Actually it was precisely Herod‚Äôs Temple which during that century became a wonder of the world to replace the modest efforts of the returned exiles.  Yet Jewish tradition never speaks of Herod‚Äôs as a ‚ÄòThird Temple.‚Äô‚Äù (North, 1990, pp. 362-363, 386)   &amp;nbsp;      Raymond A. Bowman, Ezra, *The Interpreters‚Äô Bible*, 1956, volume III   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;The books known as Ezra and Nehemiah are named not for the author but for the principal personalities encountered in each.  It is apparent from the versions that in antiquity all that is now included in these books was known under the title of Ezra‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶***Unity and Relationships***   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;Division into two books is first mentioned by Origen (A.D. 185-253), with the implication that such usage is Hebrew practice.  But in accordance with the Talmudic tradition, the oldest Hebrew indices treat Ezra-Nehemiah as a single book, and the division into two books is not found in the Hebrew Bible until the Bomberg edition of 1525.  Evidence for the original unity of the books in the Hebrew Bible is also seen in the fact that, though now separated, the Masoretic statistics and comments, usually found after each book of the Bible, are missing after Ezra 10:44, but are found for the entire work after Neh. [Nehemiah] 13:31‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;‚Ä¶both Eusebius and Melito of Sardis knew but ‚ÄúEzra,‚Äù and the oldest Christian indices of Old Testament books recognized but a single work.    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶the original literary unit was even greater than Ezra-Nehemiah.  It is a striking fact that II Chr. [Chronicles] concludes abruptly in the middle of Cyrus‚Äô edict and that II Chr. 36:22-23 is repeated in Ezra 1:1-3a, finishing the fragmentary ending of the Chronicles.  The ‚ÄúGreek Ezra,‚Äù another recension from the Hebrew text, includes even more of Chronicles, through II Chr. 35-36.  Such duplication seems a deliberate device to indicate an original connection between Ezra-Nehemiah and the books of Chronicles.  The conclusion that Ezra-Nehemiah was originally part of Chronicles is further supported by the fact that the same late Hebrew language, the same distinctive literary peculiarities s that mark the style of the Chronicler, are found throughout Ezra-Nehemiah.  The same presuppositions, interest, points of view, and theological and ecclesiastical conceptions so dominate all these writings that it is apparent that Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah was originally a literary unit, the product of one school of thought if not of a single mind, that can be called ‚Äúthe Chronicler.‚Äù    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶***Canon***   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;In the English Bible Ezra and Nehemiah follow the Chronicles as they did originally.  The English order follows the Hellenistic (Alexandrian) treatment of the books, which abolished the Jewish distinction between ‚Äúthe Prophets‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Writings.‚Äù  In the tripartite division of the Hebrew Bible (Law, Prophets, and Writings) Ezra and Nehemiah, along with Chronicles, are classified not among the ‚Äúprophetic books"" (as Samuel and Kings are), but among ‚Äúthe Writings‚Äù (like Psalms, Job and Ecclesiastes).  Such location is a witness to their relatively late composition, when the other divisions of the Hebrew Bible were regarded as closed canonically.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Modern printed Hebrew Bibles follow the German Hebrew manuscripts, which place Nehemiah between Daniel and Chronicles.  The Babylonia Jewish practice placed Ezra and Chronicles after Esther, concluding the section of ‚Äúthe Writings,‚Äù while Palestinian manuscripts began ‚Äúthe Writings‚Äù section with Chronicles and concluded it with the single work Ezra, placed after Esther and Daniel.     &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;Doubtless mere chance accounts for the omission of any reference to Ezra or Nehemiah in the New Testament, but there is a definite repudiation of Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah in the canon of the Syrian Christians‚Ä¶ There is no Targum for Ezra-Nehemiah‚Ä¶ The Nestorian canon and that adopted by several Monophysite groups omit all of Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah.    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶***Date***   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;In I Chr. 3:15-24 a genealogy purporting to list the descendants of David appears to extend six generations beyond Zerubbabel (*ca.* [approximately] 520 B.C.).  Counting thirty years to a generation, the last generation mentioned, which was presumably the Chronicler‚Äôs own, must be dated no earlier than *ca.* 350 B.C.  Support for such a date is claimed in the list of high priests in Neh. 12:10 *ff.* [and following], which includes Jaddua, whom Josephus claims (cf. [compare with] Neh. 13:28) was high priest at the time of Alexander the Great (*ca.* 332 B.C.).  Principally on such basis the majority of scholars now date the work of the Chronicler 350-250 B.C.  Resorting to more subjective criteria for dating, such as style, vocabulary, and polemics, some urge the still later date of 300-250 B.C. or even as late as some time after Ben Sirach (*ca.* 180 B.C.).  By thus assuming that the Chronicler was writing more than a century after the events he records, it is easy to understand why his statements can be challenged as unhistorical.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;However, there has been a reaction to such a late date for the Chronicler‚Ä¶ the interpretation of the supporting evidence adduced from linguistic and polemic bases in other ways, the only remaining evidence for the date is the time of the last datable event in the books ‚Äì the mission of Ezra.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Those who insist that Ezra arrived in Palestine during the interval between Nehemiah‚Äôs administrations (cf. Ezra 7:8) argue for a date soon after 432 B.C. and no earlier than 433 B.C., the end of Nehemiah‚Äôs first administration.  Since the Chronicler faultily places Ezra before Nehemiah‚Ä¶ it is suggested that several generations must have elapsed for the Chronicler to have won uncomplaining acceptance of his proposed order, and the date must be about 400 B.C.   &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;Such dating, which is possible only by emending Ezra 7:8, is weak in that it rests on the assumption that Ezra‚Äôs activity fell within the reign of Artaxerxes I, which is less likely than that he arrived during the time of Artaxerxes II (cf. Ezra 7:8).  In the latter case the Chronicler‚Äôs work could be no earlier than 397 B.C., but with a similar allowance to that mention above of time elapsed between the activity of Ezra and the work of the Chronicler, the date of the Chronicler would be no earlier than about 365-350 B.C.    &gt;‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶***Sources***   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The question of sources is closely related to that of date‚Ä¶ The great controversy over Ezra-Nehemiah is centered in this issue.  Those who posit a very late date for the Chronicler find it easy to be critical of his narrative and suspicious of his results.  They insist that the few sources he employed were preserved almost literally (c.f., Nehemiah), but most of his work is thought to be his own composition, the product of his fertile imagination and therefore unhistorical‚Ä¶ ‚Äúit is evident,‚Äù so Torrey claims, ‚Äúthat the Chronicler became an editor more from necessity than from choice.  By taste and gift he was a novelist.  He would doubtless have preferred to give freer rein to his imagination in composing the story of the Jews and their antecedents.  But he was now writing not to interest, but with an apologetic purpose‚Ä¶‚Äù   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Others tend to assign to the Chronicler a date almost contemporary with the events he records in which case the sources are less important‚Ä¶ such scholars minimize the creative activity of the Chronicler‚Ä¶. Therefore such scholars give greater historical weight to the Chronicler‚Äôs narrative‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The major difference between the two schools of interpretation thus concerns primarily that material in which the Chronicler‚Äôs style and ideas are clearly apparent‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Even a casual reader will be impressed by the evidences of the Chronicler‚Äôs use of sources in Ezra-Nehemiah.  The narrative does not always run smoothly and continuously.  Gaps occur where no actual sources were available‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶***Nehemiah‚Äôs Memoirs***. ‚Äì Although the extent of Nehemiah‚Äôs narrative is debated, no one challenges the authenticity of the memoir concerning him that the Chronicler has incorporated in his work‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶     &gt;***Nehemiah‚Äôs memoirs***, written not very long after 432 B.C. (c.f. Neh. 5:14) and preserved by the Chronicler literally, with relatively little interpolation or reworking, are one of the most accurate historical sources in the Old Testament, the only undisputed source for Jewish history between 520-175 B.C.  The memoirs appear to be a memorial inscription, a type familiar in the ancient Near East.  By placing his memoirs before God in the temple Nehemiah doubtless sought to stir the memory of the Lord regarding his good works and thereby to be assured of the ‚Äúname‚Äù that he as a eunuch (cf. Neh. 2:1) could not obtain through his posterity‚Ä¶ It was probably there in the temple archives that the Chronicler found Nehemiah‚Äôs text.    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶***Lists***. ‚Äì As in the book of Chronicles, the editor here has a distinct liking for lists and seems to supply them whenever possible‚Ä¶ Since one at least is falsely connected (Ezra 7:1-5), all are on trial, and in each case it is a question as to what extent the Chronicler invented them or used authentic material.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶***Order***   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The present chaotic order of the Ezra-Nehemiah narrative, which intermixes the story of Ezra with that of Nehemiah, is not that originally produced by the Chronicler‚Ä¶ There is no question but what Nehemiah‚Äôs memoirs were originally a separate document but it is evident that the Chronicler has made an effort to incorporate them in the plan of his total work.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Rudolph has stressed the symmetrical structure of the Chronicler‚Äôs original story of how, through the providence of God and the sympathetic co-operation of the Persian court, the Hebrew community and its temple, destroyed because of the sin of the people, were restored under the leadership of three men: Zerubbabel (Ezra 1:1-6:22); Ezra (Ezra 7:1-8:36‚Ä¶); and Nehemiah (Neh. 1:1-7:73a‚Ä¶)  Symmetrically, each of the three episodes began with an act of grace as the Persian ruler permitted or commissioned a Jewish leader to lead his fellow Jews to Palestine form exile.  In each instance those who returned promptly and vigorously began the special task of reconstruction to which they had been dedicated: rebuilding the temple (Zerubbabel); reinstituting the law (Ezra); and fortification of the city and reestablishment of the cult in the light of that law (Nehemiah).  In each case the task, despite opposition, was continued to a successful conclusion, which was then celebrated as a great festival.  The result was a rejuvenated community loyal to God and his law.  In the light of such symmetry it is likely that for the Chronicler the story of Nehemiah ended with the ceremony of the dedication of the wall and the exclusion of all foreigners from the community (Neh. 12:27-13:3)‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;The present order, which puts part of the Ezra narrative (Neh. 7:73b-8:18) in the book of Nehemiah, is due to an editor later than the Chronicler.  It was apparently he too who put the name of Nehemiah in Neh. 8:9 and the reference to Ezra in Neh. 12:36 which falsely suggest that they were contemporaries in Jerusalem.  That such confusion is relatively late is seen in the fact that in I Esdras and Josephus, Ezra precedes Nehemiah in Jerusalem and Nehemiah is not mentioned in I Esdras‚Ä¶ It was perhaps this late editor, or another like him, who placed Neh. 10 at the conclusion of the Ezra story‚Ä¶ incorporated Neh. 9:5*b*-37, and added the supplement in 11:22-23, which reflects substantially later times.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶***The Priority of Nehemiah***   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Affixing the book of Nehemiah to that of Ezra, whether by the Chronicler or by a later editor‚Ä¶ created a chronological problem regarding the order of appearance of Ezra and Nehemiah in Jerusalem.  It is natural to assume that the one mentioned first was the first to arrive, and this traditional order has many defenders‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;In solution for the chronological problem it was proposed in 1889 that Nehemiah was active under Artaxerxes I (464-423 B.C.) while Ezra, if historical, came to Jerusalem under Artaxerxes II (404-358 B.C.) This thesis, propounded, expanded, and defended for years by Albin Van Hoonacker, until it has become associated with his name, has always been under attack but has nevertheless gained many adherents.    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;‚Ä¶it is most probable that Nehemiah preceded Ezra in Palestine.  Rebuttals to this view are strictly defensive and are often devious an ingenious rather than persuasive.    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;The chronological problem seems best solved by assigning Ezra to the period of Artaxerxes II, as suggested long ago.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶**Historicity**    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;For those who, on the basis of a theory of literal inspiration of scripture, accept Ezra-Nehemiah at its face value as historical, there is no problem of chronology or historicity, since the biblical narrative is regarded as the truth with which the present puzzling chronology is someday expected to be seen in agreement.  Those at the other extreme, who hold that the Chronicler writes unhistorical fiction instead of history, forging speeches and documents and expounding his fictional ‚Äúhistory‚Äù as he imagined it occurred, likewise have no chronological or historical problems.  They reject all of the Chronicler‚Äôs views out of hand as unhistorical, and regard it impossible to know the actual historical truth of the Persian period in Palestine since Neh. 1:1-7:73a ‚Äúis the only unimpeachable source for Jewish history between Haggai and Zechariah in 520-516 and I Maccabees for the period 175-135.‚Äù  ‚Ä¶ Between these extremes are the many who recognize the errors and inaccuracies in the Chronicler‚Äôs narrative but also acknowledge that there is more or less historical material in his work.    &gt;‚Ä¶    &gt;It is usual to regard Ezra as the embodiment of the later particularistic and legalistic Judaism, but it is clear that he was also its fountain head.  Cowley has declared:   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;&gt;It was Ezra who made modern Judaism, by instituting (or re-instituting) the ceremonial law and formulating regulations for the national festivals.  The books of Ezra and Nehemiah show this as clearly as the early literature shows the lack of them‚Ä¶ The importance of the new revelation [law] is that in it we see the birth of modern Judaism, which could never have developed by natural process from pre-exilic Judaism.  The subsequent development of it down to the present day is easily traced‚Ä¶ All this is the natural growth of the system born under Ezra.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶***Theological Significance***   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;With a more recent development of universalistic thought and of impatience with legal restrictions, especially in religion, the work of Ezra-Nehemiah has been greatly neglected, regarded as negative in character, and considered significant only for its possible factual content.  Properly understood, however, the value of the work goes far beyond its historical import.  Rarely in the Bible is there expressed such a sense of intimate relationship with God and consciousness of his providence as is found in Nehemiah‚Äôs frequent observations that the ‚Äúhand of God‚Äù guided and defended him in his holy work‚Ä¶ Always Nehemiah was confident that the almost impossible task of reviving the desolate Jewish community could not be accomplished without the guidance and support of God‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The work of Ezra, too, although often scorned today because of its particularism and legalism, likewise has enduring significance when seen in proper perspective‚Ä¶ The great prophets had declaimed against the menace of Canaanite and other foreign religious influences and had declared that continued acceptance of such seduction forces would lead to divine displeasure, exile, and destruction.  Ezra admitted the truth of the prophetic contention and, recognizing that all intimate foreign contacts inherently presented an insidious possibility of contamination of the cult, he urged that such ‚Äúcancerous growths‚Äù should be removed, surgically if necessary, in order that a sound Jewish cult might survive, avoiding a repetition of divine displeasure and of the destruction which had come, as the prophets had warned, because of the ready acceptance of foreign influences, particularly in religion‚Ä¶ The real test of the value of the policy of exclusion came with the onset of the Hellenistic Age‚Ä¶ As might be expected, some Jews accepted Hellenism and reveled in their new freedom but it was such a conservative an exclusivistic group as the Hasidim that preserved Judaism and led the way toward Christianity.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Since Paul, Christians have looked with contempt upon the legalistic development of Judaism and have rejected the ‚Äúburden‚Äù of the Law as a means of salvation.  But such a view often distorts the truth.  Even Paul had to combat in the church the antinomian tendencies that his words and attitudes on the subject had released.  Although not all Jewish laws need to be binding upon Christians, nevertheless there were Christians laws or principles by which religious conduct must be guided, and Paul himself was often most explicit about these.  There are few men with adequate religious sensitivity and discernment to understand and appreciate and make effective the law that God writes in every human heart‚Ä¶ most men require an objective guide of conduct.  Such abstractions as ‚Äúholiness‚Äù and ‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù must be spelled out in concrete expression.  The average man wants these explanations to be adequate but in minimal terms.  He asks, ‚ÄúHow far can I go and still be righteous?‚Äù  or ‚ÄúWhat must I do to be saved?‚Äù  Jewish law met the issue by supplying a specific code of conduct, recognized as the will of God.  Strict adherence to it constituted righteousness.  Therein lay both its positive force and its corrupting influence.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/Quakers.jsonl,Quakers.jsonl,kvnixm,Travelling Quaker who settled in a town with the only meeting I don't like going to.,"I started attending meetings in 2006 in Las Vegas NV. Due to my career, I had to move a lot and attended many meeting groups, all of which I loved in places like Honolulu, Berkeley, Oakland, Inland Valley, San Mateo, Visalia, etc.   I loved every one of them and felt an incredible sense of kinship and community in all of these places. I found that these meetings centered me and that I started to need my weekly centering. When I relocated most recently I chose a town near my job that had a quaker meeting. Never in my life have I ever been uncomfortable or felt unwelcome in a meeting, but this town that I live in now is the exception. The mean age of the group is around 80 and the members are little on the scolding side. They insist on singing in the meeting (which I am personally uncomfortable with) but they made it clear that if I want to be part of this meeting I will have to sing too. The thing that irritates me most is that so many of the members are scolds, oftentimes using moments where they are ""guided to speak the truth"" during silent worship to chastise, argue and rebuke one another.   I would literally do anything to get back the feelings I had at any other meeting house but right now I cannot stand to be around these crabby, garrulous octagenarians who insist that I become more like them.   I need advice. What can I do?","Is this Meeting part of a larger Monthly Meeting / Area Meeting. And, if so, are all the local Meetings within that the same? If they‚Äôre not all like that, there may be some Elders you can speak to at Monthly Meeting, who could provide a little direction to some of your local Meeting‚Äôs members?

The fact that the indoctrination sinks in differently for different people, and that there are radically different expectations among the sexes leads to a lot of marital discord. If married couples are patient, then a lot have been saved and understandings can be reached. In other cases, divorce is the end result and even the best option that frees parties to pursue what they want in life. If church is going to be primary for one person, over the marriage, then that is a case where walking away might be beneficial to both.   The subreddit is also a source of information. Forcing children to attend is part of the equation in most mormon households. Mormonism's cookie cutter basic life goals shoehorn people into doing things they may not want to do. There is a great big world out there that doesn't include the fraud of mormonism. Women can pursue their dreams and not be forced to be a SAHM. The subreddit works to get the word out and gives people ideas about how to proceed in the most beneficial ways. That might include biding ones time until they're able to financially support themselves, i.e. pay for college, pay rent, etc.  It has just crossed the 37k subscription level. It will be interesting to see how long before the growth curve bends due to diminishing residual populations...i.e. a ceiling of 5 million mormons seems an upper limit. The 15 million figure is pie-in-the-sky and the limit also involves so many mormons who are alive but not really online, or not really caring enough to subscribe to a sub devoted to it.

Josh. [Joshua] 7:24 ff. [and following]).  The concept was fortified by the fact that captivity, exile, and return were regarded as group experiences, shared by guilty and innocent alike.‚Äù (Bowman, 1955, p. III 652)   &amp;nbsp;    -2.

Still less does ‚Äòmaximum enforceableness for existing religious authorities‚Äô take precedence over profoundly human obligations of commutative justice.  On the other hand, the need of safeguarding religious truth and duty is also a natural law obligation; but the fact that the conduct of those influenced by Ezra is presented in the Bible as praiseworthy and normative does not mean that it is impeccable or inerrant.‚Äù (North, 1990, p. 391)   &amp;nbsp;     -4. ‚ÄúRise, for upon you is the **word**,    and we are with you;    strengthen and do.‚Äù   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;‚ÄúThe proposal for mending the broken relationship with God called for undoing as far as possible the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô that had been done, and for trusting in the grace of God for forgiveness for what could not be undone.  The remedy is harsh, ignoring human anguish and reflecting the low estimate of women and children as chattels to be disposed of at will, disregarding their desire and ignoring their human rights.  It is in full agreement with the historically ruthless attitude of the Hebrews toward non-Hebraic inhabitants of Palestine (cf. Josh. 9:24-27; 11:20, 22-23; I Sam.

By **the law** is meant that which Ezra had recently introduced in Judea (cf. Neh. 8), but the present Pentateuchal legislation has no prohibition against foreign marriages in general (cf. 9:11-12).

[approximately] 408 B.C.; Cowley‚Ä¶).  Since **Jehohanan** was grandson or descendant of **Eliashib**, rather than his son (Neh. 12:10-11, 22; cf. Ezra 5:1), several generations separated the two high priesthoods.  Since Nehemiah was a contemporary of **Eliashib** (Neh. 3:1; 13:4) and **Jehohanan** is here a contemporary of Ezra, the sequence Nehemiah-Ezra is demonstrated (A. Van Hoonacker‚Ä¶.1923‚Ä¶)‚Ä¶ The verb ◊ï◊ô◊ú◊ö [*VahYahLeKh*], **and when he came**, is a simple scribal corruption of ◊ï◊ô◊ú◊ü [VahYahLeeN], **where he spent the night**, as I Esdras 9:2, the Peshitta [the ancient Syriac translation of the Bible], and the LXX^L [the Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation of the Bible] show.‚Äù (Bowman, 1955, p. III 654)   &amp;nbsp;      -7. And they **passed a voice** in **YeHOo-DaH** [""YHVH Knew"", Judah] **and Jerusalem** to all sons of the exile to collect [at] Jerusalem.    -8.

[Masoretic Text, the authorized Hebrew Bible] can be read either **they made proclamation**, with an indefinite subject or **a proclamation was made**.  The **proclamation** presupposes a courier (cf. 1:1) to spread the summons through **Judah and Jerusalem**‚Ä¶ Promptness and full participation were ensured by a severe penalty imposed on laggards and those who ignored the summons‚Ä¶ As part of the Persian Empire, subject to control and close observation (4:11 ff.; 5:6-17), not even a Jewish executive council could act in the proposed highhanded manner without such consent of the government as Ezra had won (7:26).  **Property** of the guilty was to be confiscated, but the term used originally meant that it was to be devoted to God and condemned to human use (cf. Josh. 6:17-21)‚Ä¶   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;The guilty were to be **banned** from the society of true Israel.  The Hebrew word translated **congregation** (*qƒÅhƒÅl*; cf. vs. [verse] 1) here means the politico-ethnic group of Jews.  Only exiles were believed to constitute this group, but the Peshitta properly interprets it as ‚Äòthe people of Israel.‚Äô‚Äù (Bowman, 1955, pp. III 654-655)   &amp;nbsp;    -9.

The northern boundary of Judah was traced south of Jerusalem (Josh. 15:8; 18:16), which was counted as Benjaminite (Judg. [Judges] 1:21), as in the Talmud^1 later, where it is claimed that the major part of the temple was in Benjamin with the great altar of sacrifice on Judean soil‚Ä¶ Although the sympathies of Benjamin were largely with the seceding tribes at the division of the kingdom (cf. II Sam. 20:1-2; I Kings 12:20), the Chronicler, as well as the priestly writer later, regarded **Judah and Benjamin** as the two tribes loyal to the house of David (I Kings 12:12=II Chr. [Chronicles] 11:1).   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Ä¶The assembly was held at the end of three days (vs. 8), on the twentieth day of the ninth month (Kislev), presumably in the year of Ezra‚Äôs arrival (7:8), which would be December 18, 397 B.C.  The month usually marks the beginning of **the great rain** of Palestine, when the **heavy rain** (cf. I Kings 18:41; Ezek. 13:11) saturates the earth and fills the cistern‚Ä¶  The Hebrew word (*re·∏•√¥bh*) denotes breadth of space and is used sometimes parallel to ‚Äòoutside‚Äô (Jer. 5:1).  It is often used of a place near a gate (cf. II Chr. 32:6; Job 29:7) where assemblies were held (II Chr. 29:4) and proclamations and speeches were made (Prov. [Proverbs] 1:20; Esth.

III 661)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶ there is some room to doubt whether they did put them finally away; for, several years after, Nehemiah found Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab, Neh. chap.

In the Masoretic enumeration of sections, &amp;c. both books are conjoined.  This may be seen at the end of Nehemiah.‚Äù (Clarke, 1831, pp. II 636-637)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶ all in all, it is not so clear that mixed marriages were prohibited before or even in Deut. [Deuteronomy]   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;We must conclude that religion of its very nature is both protective and diffusive‚Ä¶ simultaneously universalist, to bring all people to the benefits its votaries enjoy, and separatist, to protect them from the contamination and loss of their ‚Äòtreasure of great price.‚Äô  The proportions in which these two antithetical obligations are to be combined will call for human prudential judgments, which even among the maximally sincere and zealous will not always be objectively right.‚Äù (North, 1990, p. 391)   &amp;nbsp;   &gt;There aren‚Äôt many sorrier episodes in the Bible.     &amp;nbsp;  **FOOTNOTES**   &amp;nbsp;    ^1 The **Talmud** Hebrew: ◊™÷∑÷º◊ú÷∞◊û◊ï÷º◊ì ""instruction, learning"" is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism. The term ""Talmud"" normally refers to the collection of writings named specifically the Babylonian Talmud, although there is also an earlier collection known as the Jerusalem Talmud, or Palestinian Talmud.   &amp;nbsp;    The Talmud has two components: the Mishnah (Hebrew: ◊û◊©◊†◊î, c. 200 CE), a written compendium of Rabbinic Judaism's Oral Torah; and the Gemara (c. 500 CE), an elucidation of the Mishnah and related Tannaitic writings that often ventures onto other subjects and expounds broadly on the Hebrew Bible.   &amp;nbsp;   The entire Talmud consists of 63 tractates, and in standard print is over 6,200 pages long. It is written in Tannaitic Hebrew and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and contains the teachings and opinions of thousands of rabbis (dating from before the Common Era through the fifth century CE) on a variety of subjects, including Halakha (law), Jewish ethics, philosophy, customs, history, lore and many other topics. The Talmud is the basis for all codes of Jewish law, and is widely quoted in rabbinic literature. - Wikipedia   &amp;nbsp;    **Bibliography**    Bowman, R. A. (1955).

But the existential status of every other El was not so easy to formulate, esp. [especially] in treating diplomatically with the Great Powers who worshiped their own El (not the uncommitted tact of Huram‚Äôs reply in v [verse] 12).  Basically, the devout Israelite felt that every other El had been degraded to the status of Yahweh‚Äôs footstool (Ps [Psalm] 95:7); however, insofar as they were, if anything, supraearthly or heavenly beings, their status was thus imperceptibly merged with that of the angels, as the LXX [Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible] sometimes renders *‚Äôƒïl≈çh»ãm* (Ps 8:6).  The OT [Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible] rarely or never (even in Pss [Psalms] 96:5; 135:6,15; 115:4) comes out and says that idols are not gods at all, that only Yahweh is God.

I got off in San Diego, CA waited for like 4 hours to back up to Oceanside, CA which was stupid. I got off on Oceanside and realized that my plan off becoming homeless here in Oceanside isn't such a good idea since I guy told me how they were giving all the homeless people tickets for staying out in the streets. Wtf?! how do you give a homeless person a ticket for not having a house?! and so if they accumulate after a while they take you to jail so yeah, I left Oceanside and decided that going to a small little town of about 15,000 called Fallbrook would be my best option because I had Vista on my mind and remembered that the county jail is in Vista and I got in trouble for tagging before with a misdemeanor and anything else could get me a felony or something idk but yeah I ended up coming to Fallbrook and I am now in Fallbrook turning in resumes and applying for jobs but at the same time very much aware that I am as we like to say in this ""society"" ""homeless"". I am scared that the police here in this small little city could frisk me or whatever and all that stuff and give me a ticket and all that stuff. I am not wanting to be dramatic or very sad about life but honestly if death came to me right now in this very moment in time in my life I would be the most happiest person on this planet. It is hard and my dumbass was so eager to leave WA that I only left with about 220 and now i'm down to about 70. great. I have some money coming in from I job I was working before I came here but that isn't until this Friday. All of the people offering me to stay with them all smoke pot and smoke cigarettes in which I don't do these things that's why I don't want to stay with them because I used to do those things with them allot even hash, spice, whip its from the dust off cans, whip its from the nos tanks... yeah I am a idiot let me beat you to that before you do. That is why I don't want to go back to Vista either and chose Fallbrook which is 20 mins from Vista but here in Fallbrook I know absolutely no ones. I feel lonely and scared is my best way to put it. My diet is consisting of cured and smoked meats with cheese which is saving me money and the protein is taking away my hunger and I am running on 2 hrs of sleep from these last 2 days.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/FAITH.jsonl,FAITH.jsonl,onb1mw,Being back in church live and in person,"Being in church live and in person  Since Covid I haven't been to church. I still watch service online on Wednesday nights and Sunday mornings because my church hasn't opened back up yet but to me it's not the same. I need to be in church, I need to be around other believers, I need to feel the holy spirit and the word. So when I found out that my daughter's boyfriend's church was opening live I decided that no matter what I was going.  I asked all my church friends to come with me but it didn't work out with them, it didn't matter I was going anyway. When I got outside all dressed up, I found my tire was flat. I had to get my air machine from the shed, here I was  looking for it, all dressed up in heels. Then as I started to fill my tire and the rain came.  I yelled the devil is a liar I am going. I filled it enough to get to the gas station but the first one the pump was broken, the second one stole my money and didn't work. I did not care, low tire or not I was going. When I got there it started raining and I forgot my mask and had to go back to the car. It seemed like everything was trying to keep me from getting there, still I was determined and nothing was going to stop me.  Being in the house of God is something special, it's a feeling you can't get at home. A group of believers that come together and give love and praise to God. It's that feeling of the holy spirit that comes when one or more come together to praise his name. I also believe there is always a message for me, when I need it, when I come to church and of course today was no different.  Part of the message was that you don't need to be family to be a family. When someone has your back, you are blessed, we are all God's family. We who are strong need to build others up who aren't as strong. Part of the message was for my bestie who didn't show about stop entertaining foolishness, she needed to hear that.  So in today's time with everything going on, there are so many of us asking is God listening? So much hurt, so much racism, so much craziness we can't help to ask is God listening? When you cry every night, when you're lost and broken and you cry out, God are you listening? We've all been there. But we need to base our values on the hope of Jesus. But he is listening, he hears you, he knows your pain and he is there for you but he also needs us to do things on our end. We need to be the salt and the light, we need to tell others about him and his goodness even when we are confused, and think he's not listening, we need to be true believers. Our responsibility is to bring together everyone to Jesus. We must have the strength to love as Martin Luther King so beautifully said.  We must do this for our world, our cities, our neighborhoods to strengthen each other in love. So many people today are worshiping the wrong things. Ask yourself, are you worshiping money? Fame? Likes? Followers? We need to come back, we need to turn away from idols and turn back to God.  Removing your idiots makes space for God, because the only thing that changes the heart of a man is opening up to God.  We don't need people's approval, we don't need likes or followers, we need God's love and approval.  We need to restructure our strength. Each of us should praise our neighbors for their good, we need to build them up.  We need to be tough minded and tender hearted. Unmoved in our faith, we need to believe in God, we need to know his works, and we need to realize that it will come but in his time. We need to remember that we are all one, that God created each of us in his likeness, in his image. So how can we hate each other? How can we let others suffer? We are all the same, from the same father.  We need to strengthen each other, lift each other up. Help others in need, help those that don't have what we have. Our privilege needs to help those who do not have privilege. In these times there is a strength that will be needed, a spirit like strength that loves the unlovable, that helps the broken, that shows the light to those in the darkness.   I remember what God said therefore it is not for your sake that I am going to do these things. I will give you a new heart and put in you a new heart. I will put in you my spirit and move you to follow me. Rest in the strength of our God that he will restore and give us the strength of love, for everyone.  So today my friends this was the message, it was for me and hopefully for you as well. Being in church made me do the ugly cry, as I was so overwhelmed with God's grace and mercy. I was so very grateful for being there and for everything he has done and continues to do in my life. I know I am not where I want to be, I know there are things I pray for that have not yet come but I still hold on. I know I now have the things I used to pray for, so that keeps me going. So don't give up, hold on and if you can, go back to a place that makes you feel closer to God, wherever that may be for you.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_active/Catholicism.jsonl,Catholicism.jsonl,1ji4nm,I've read the arguments.,"There have been a few posts, including [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1jgeuk/explain_why_homosexuality_is_wrong/) (which links to others in the comments), regarding the issue of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. I've read the arguments (natural law, etc.), and they all make complete sense to me. My big issue here is, even though the arguments work, does that make them right?  This issue is a big one for me, and as a Catholic I am finding it very hard to deal with. I've been praying a lot on it lately. I have my own beliefs, because I feel like the teachings of the Church are damaging to the individuals affected, no matter what we say or how we say it. To me, it feels like Jesus would act very differently. So how do we deal with this?  Edit: Thank you everyone who responded, and God bless. I really appreciate the kindness in the discussion.","This is bound to be difficult when any sin is normalized (becomes in the popular mindset not sinful). There are *many* things in the Western context that fall in here, including the issue of homosexual behavior.  You must then choose what to believe and then act accordingly. Ask yourself these simple yes/no questions:  - Does God exist? - Does sin exist? (I'm talking *any* and *all* sin) - Does it matter if we sin? - Is there such thing as objective sinful behavior? - Can we know what is sin? - Can we trust those who teach to show us what is sin? - Does what society accept as common make it not a sin? - Does what society accept as common make it less of a sin?  These are all simple yes/no answers you have to answer. Then you have to act accordingly within society, in all charity and humility as any sinner should.  Jesus would say (and does say) completely: ""I love you. I do not condemn you. Go and sin no more."" These all go together.","I've seen them too and wonder when they will stop.  I looked over on r/islam and none of the past 50 posts related to what appears to be a current obsession here.  Maybe I should go onto r/sodomy and do a self post about how I understand modern society is embracing this lifestyle but to me it feels like it's just wrong.  I wonder how I would be received?  Sorry for the aside.  u/You know what you has posed the key questions to you.

I haven't officially left the church yet, or announced my doubts in it to my family (for obvious reasons). My mom is already aware that I'm not going on a mission, which made her cry, causing me to leave the house for the rest of the day, but I don't think she has let the rest of my family know in hopes that I change my mind. I am about to move out of the house to go to college for this fall semester and am gonna be only a few hours away from home, but that's close enough to my parents that I'm sure they'll pop in passing through every so often. My sister (who is a very understanding person that I believe will respect my beliefs hopefully) will be living in the same area as me also.   I am worried that when I leave the church it'll come out to my family quick, whether through my sister or myself, I don't think I could keep something this big from her, with her being so close and basically in my community I guess? My dad is your super stereotypical mormon father preaching love while hating at anyone different at the same time, he is also a loved member of the community who don't know him like I do. My mom is fairly similar but I feel as if she tries to emotional manipulate me to do things she wants. Ex: I told her I couldn't do FSY this summer because I am an adult now, but she called me telling me that they changed the rules and graduating 18 year olds could go. I held my ground and told her I didn't really want to go anyway and I could be working saving up anyway. She immediately got all pissed and after a little back and forth I said, ""I'm sorry you feel this way,"" to which she aggressively said, ""No you aren't,"" and she hung up on me, and we didn't talk for the rest of the day.  One of my brothers is really into the church history so I don't feel like I could sufficiently hold my ground in a debate with him, which he is a bit of a debate lord, so this is a genuine terror that lives in my mind. My other brother is a very kind person, but I feel the environment of my home and Utah in general makes him a little misguided. But he always makes little comments like, ""DacaPesci, you aren't just gonna leave the church when you move out right?"" or ""Do you really want to be with our family forever? You're not just saying that?""  Like I love my family but I feel like I'm being manipulated, and that if I express these feelings, I feel like they would outcast me and/or make me meet with my bishop/give me sources I don't trust at this point.   I have struggled with lots of anxiety and depression but haven't gone to my family because they'll try to spin it around to religion, when I think that is one of the causes of said anxiety and depression, making it worse in the long run. Luckily I have friends and other outlets so don't worry about me, I'm gonna work on finding a therapist after all of this goes down haha.  As I stated earlier, I am gonna be going to college, and that comes with school fees and rent as well, which I am prepared for, I have almost 12k saved up right now. But my parents INSIST they pay for school and rent, even though I tell them I am capable and happier to do this myself. I'm worried that they'll try to use this against me if I do decide to leave, more emotional manipulation. I'm not positive if they would do this, but it's a fear I have, ya know?  I JUST DON'T WANT MY FAMILY TO BE DISAPPOINTED, but they will be. This is the right thing to do right? The only reasonable thing? I have been doing my own research in politics, religion, and more that stands against so much I've been taught. I don't hate the LGBTQ community, they deserve the same love I was fortunate enough to get from even people like my parents. I don't think it makes sense that nobody cares about the racism even in modern church history, and that they justify it because, ""God told Brigham Young, not yet, eventually, but not yet."" Some of the bigoted and hateful things I've heard have been from my own father, and some of my siblings agree it's terrible, but do nothing about it. I just don't want to feel this feeling that I'm pretending to be someone I'm not, someone who is better, someone trying to be like Jesus. I was someone who had such a strong testimony thinking, ""Why would anyone want to leave?"" but now I'm trying to think of how I can salvage the pieces of my family relationships left after all this is over.  That was a lot to unpack, I've never expressed so much about this topic, I kinda just shove it down, but I feel a little peace now it's going out to the world. Once again, I'm sorry for the trauma dump, and how incoherent my thoughts are, it's all just complicated and hard to express  TL;DR: Manipulated kid is scared to ruin his family life over cult","Congrats on your upcoming college experience. I think it'll be a great move for you.  First off, you don't *have* to tell anyone where you stand with the church. If you really feel like you want to, do it via email or text. Keep it short and to the point, and keep it focused on *your* beliefs, feelings, and impressions. Anything else will open room for debate. But seriously, keep it super short. You don't owe them an explanation, and if they're not ready to understand, your explanation will be lost on them.  Whether they are disappointed or not is their business, not yours. You can't make everyone happy. And do not ever put their happiness above your wellbeing. If your family are good people, in time they will be able to accept your decision. In the meantime, develop yourself and your abilities, seek out meaningful relationships (romantic and otherwise), explore yourself to understand your dreams, desires, and ambitions. And it's okay for those to change in a few years. Show your family by example how much good and joy exists in the world outside of their religion.",First thing that I see is everyone tells young adults that if they are 18 they need to make sure they have a bank account that isn‚Äôt co signed by their parents. Make sure you have gotten your own account since turning 18. Some people who have left the church have had their money stolen by their parents. I‚Äôm not saying your parents would do this but better safe than sorry.  This isn‚Äôt a small thing so it‚Äôs ok to be terrified. I was and still am.  It‚Äôs really hard to know if you can salvage relationships. More than likely you can but at the same time it depends on your family and their personalities. Also they may shock you. I told my  parents a week ago (not my siblings or anyone else yet) and my parents shocked me. I thought one of my parents might disown me. I told them I didn‚Äôt want to disappoint them which got a ‚Äúwell we are disappointed... extremely disappointed!‚Äù And I was also asked when the last time I read my Book of Mormon. My Dad realized I had done insane amounts of studying on church history and doctrines and I think I knew more details than him. He wants me to slow down and continue to study I think. But I‚Äôm done done. Luckily I think my relationship with them will be ok. Time will tell.   I think part of it also depends on if you already have a decent relationship with them or not. I honestly wish you the best of luck. Be prepared with your own bank account and be ready for them to pull the plug on helping you pay rent and stuff just in case. It would be a blow and maybe you guys would need to have some space but I honestly hope you can salvage your relationships and I wish you the best of luck!,comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.2614652086

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/humanism.jsonl,humanism.jsonl,3gungq,"Humanism and ""fat shaming""","In my opinion, obesity is a symptom of a health problem that usually leads to other health problems.  Obese people can be wonderful human beings and should be loved and respected just as any other person.  However, I get irritated when I see [attempts](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stunning-nude-photos-celebrate-love-of-all-shapes-and-sizes_55ca71d5e4b0f1cbf1e6b1db?kvcommref=mostpopular) (NSFW) at making obesity beautiful.  I'm all for avoiding derogatory or hurtful language with obese people just as I wouldn't deride someone with a skin condition, missing limbs, or any other kind of health issue.  It's not nice, and I don't want to hurt people's feelings.  Yet, I feel that a lot of obese people remain obese because they are not taking care of themselves, which is something that shouldn't be celebrated.  Thoughts?  Am I a fat shamer?  What should be Humanism's stance on the obese?","No, you are not a fat shamer. This is akin to taking nude pictures of people smoking, claiming that an over consumption of tobacco is sexy.  My stance is that overweight people are people... Equal members of humanity... But they have a bad habit (because it does not promote their long-term survival). Their bad habit should not be glorified.","I think it's a lot more difficult than simply taking care of yourself. I know people who eat healthy, work out daily, and could still be considered obese. Shit, they're healthier than me, but I'm skinnier. I think it's a lot more than simply putting effort in.   I think the biggest problem with fat shamers is the inability to empathize with other people. Fat people don't want to be fat any more than poor people want to be poor. Both are often the result of something they're unable to choose, like the region they were born in or the economic stance of their family (or both).   Imagine you're fat. People regularly look at you with disgust, you've been made fun of the entire time you went through school, you're certain that you're going to be alone and unhappy for the rest of your life. Why would you try to get in better shape? Society has rejected you. It's all about empathy, imagining how defeated a fat person feels when all they get is hate, when they feel awful about themselves.   I think the argument that fat shaming will push people to change is an argument made by people who have never experienced depression. When you're depressed, any determination to change you may have once had is gone. You feel worthless, useless, a waste of life. Why would you try to get in shape? Now let's say you see those pictures and you realize that you, a hypothetical fat person, aren't ugly. In fact, you're attractive in your own way. I don't think a person who feels good about their body is going to continue to eat. A person who feels good about their body will go to the gym rather than sit at home out of embarrassment. A person who feels good about their body is *happier*. What's wrong with that?  Sorry for the wall of text. I just have a lot of feelings about this, though my beliefs may not reflect those of humanism. I think humanism is all about empathy and rational thought, and it's neither empathetic nor rational to shame fat people in an attempt to get them to change.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.2761123002

Krishna was not all knowing Krishna was not All powerful Krishna was not holy (examples?) Krishna told lies (examples?)  (So Ram was the epitome of godly characteristics and then in the next avatar there was Krishna. Any theologists who want to shed light on these instances would be highly appreciated and thanked.)","That sounds like a strange blog post. Rama and Krishna are two manifestations of God in Hinduism. Vaishnavism, in particular, focuses on these manifestations of God. They are considered to be equally God-like, but in different social roles and with different moods. Gaudiya Vaishnavism considers Krishna to be the ultimate, supreme expression of divinity. The content of the blog, as you have described it, suggests a lack of understanding of these theologies.   1. **Did Krishna engage in sinful behaviors?**: In the Bhagavad Gita, which was spoken during the Battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna says that he comes to Earth when there is a rise in *adharma*, to reestablish the principles of *dharma*. *Adharma* is translated as ""irreligion,"" and *dharma* in this context is often translated as ""religion"". This purpose is one of the governing principles and motivations of his activities, as both Krishna and Rama. Regarding breaking ""dharma"" to win a battle, Krishna may have not followed some of the rules of battle that were the social standard of the time. These were social rules, not the eternal principles of religion that are normally termed ""dharma.""   2. **Krishna's relationships with women.** This is a very complex topic. A [""womanizer""](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/womanize) is someone who ""engages in numerous casual sexual affairs with women."" Synonyms include ""philanderer,"" ""playboy,"" and ""debauchee."" These are terms that it didn't used to be uncommon to read in old Orientalist studies of India (by the British colonizers). These are very contrary to the conception of Krishna's relationship from within the tradition, and very contrary to what is actually described in the scriptures. Very basically, every devotee of God has an eternal relationship with the divine. That relationship can be as a parent to Krishna, a friend of Krishna, a servant of Krishna, or a romantic partner. In Krishna's activities on Earth, all of these relationships are exhibited. And, *each* relationship is a personal, one-on-one relationship between God and the individual. It is based on love, not sex, not lust, and not exploitation.     3. **Stealing butter**: This is one of the most beloved activities of Krishna from his childhood on Earth. His mother was holding him in her lap and nursing him, when she noticed something in the kitchen was boiling over. She had to put Krishna down and tend to the pot. Little Krishna threw a baby tantrum! He toddled off, broke a pot that held freshly churned butter, and started distributing it to monkeys and eating it himself. His mother found him and realized she needed to discipline him for his misbehavior, just as any mother worries about correcting the bad behavior of their children. She was so involved in her relationship as a loving parent, she was completely forgetful that her child was actually God. To put him in time-out and prevent him from wandering about and getting into danger, she tried to tether him to a heavy grinding stone. But, no matter how much rope she used, it was always two finger-widths too short. Until Krishna agreed to be bound, it wasn't possible for his mother to do so. Finally, his mother gave up, and then Krishna's heart melted at her love and care, and he agreed to let her bind him. This is an example of a sweet story from Krishna's childhood. It's not about theft, it's about love.  4. **Omniscience, omnipotence, holiness**: These are expressly qualities of Krishna. He exhibited them quite clearly in many instances. Even as a newborn baby, he exhibited obvious markers of being holy. As a child, incredibly powerful assassins repeatedly came to kill him, and he easily fought and defeated them. I can't think of an example of him not exhibiting these qualities, so the claim is a little hard to refute specifically, unless you would like quotes from the Bhagavad Gita in which he describes these qualities in himself.  5. **Krishna's Honesty**: Yes, I too would need examples to fully deal with this. But, I suppose I would (for starters) refer to #1 above.  Lord Rama was born in a royal family. He was a prince who was to become the king. His behavior was regal, more formal, and more concerned with the social mores of the time. As Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, whatever actions a great person performs, common people follow. As a social role model and the head of state, this principle was prominent in Lord Rama's behavior.   Lord Krishna was raised in an agrarian community. His childhood was very informal, and he relished relationships with many friends and family members. As a youth, he moved to a big city and began his formal education. As a young man, he married and engaged in family life. His activities were predominantly oriented around these relationships with servants, friends, family, and romantic partners. It's not that this is *less* Godly, but (particularly for Gaudiya Vaishnavas) it is the height of Godliness.  I hope this helps!",That's an excellent reply.

For something so pivotal in the Catholic belief system I have rarely seen a consistent explanation of what exactly hell is and what it entails.  On one hand I have accounts of lakes of fire, skin being ripped from bone, torturous tastes, sounds and feelings. On the other I have explanations similar to the idea of the limbo of infants, being given knowledge of God and realising that they won't be with him, but no other torture.   It seems really odd to me that we are being asked to make such a big decision on faith whilst not even having basic knowledge about the choices, how is that a just system by any measure?   I've been told that no one who desires Heaven, even a little, will end up in hell and on the other hand being told that a Catholic dying in mortal sin will go to Hell (they certainly desire Heaven).  I can't seem to find any consistent information about such a pivotal question and its really harming my faith whenever it comes up. It always seems to make me question what I understand about Jesus's nature.","Hell is a place where the souls, and after the resurrection of the dead the bodies as well, of the damned are confined forever. Most have thought it is within the earth, some have thought it is on the surface of the earth, and others have proposed that it is within the Sun or on the Moon or Mars, or altogether outside the confines of this world, but as St John Chrysostom said, ""do not ask how to get to hell, but how to get away from hell."" The punishments of hell are twofold. The primary punishment of all the souls in hell is the pain of loss (*poena damni*), the deprivation of the beatific vision. Since the beatific vision is an infinite good, its loss is an infinite pain. There is also the pain of sense (*poena sensus*), which Scripture speaks of as the ""fire"" of hell, commonly held by theologians to be material fire. This is the distinction envisioned by the Council of Florence's definition that those who die in original sin alone and those who die after having personally committed unremitted mortal sins go to hell, but to suffer unequal punishments. The common opinion of theologians is that those who die in original sin alone do not suffer the *poena sensus* at all. As for those guilty of actual mortal sin, it is commonly thought, and the definition of Florence may also mean, that they also suffer a gradation of punishments in proportion to their guilt.","Remember, even the positive fires of hell are a mercy given by God",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.9853585873

Religious Taoism has gained several deities and rituals and such through the influence of other religions in China. Philosophical Taoism is simply following the books of Taoism, the Tao Te Ching, Zhuangzi, and (to some extent) the Liezi, sans dieties. In general though, we are all working towards enlightenment.  A general summary of my beliefs is:   1. The Tao is limitless, unknowable, and unnameable (The Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao)  2. The Tao is everything and all things are the Tao  3. Distinctions between things are artificial. I mean everything. From Good and Evil to Male and Female to Real and Unreal. Everything is the Tao, giving things names creates an artificial distinction between the two.  4. You can't try to control things. You should try to understand Yin and Yang, they are opposite, yet inseparable. There are times to give and times to receive. Times to advance, times to retreat. Basically, go with the flow and things will work out.  5. Let go of everything (still working on this). To quote the Tao Te Ching ""The Sage has, but doesn't possess"". Let things come and go from your life, and don't try to hold on to things that are going. This means money, possessions, people, emotions, and even yourself.  There's more to it than just that, though it's not as important. If I need it to answer a question, I will.  EDIT: For some more information, you can also check us out at /r/taoism/ .

I grew up in a culturally Muslim household in that our home country is one where Islam is a majority religion. That being said, I never once prayed, never identified as a Muslim, nothing. In fact, I hated Islam growing up as 9/11 happened prior to my conversion. Many years of studying and researching various religions, I eventually found myself in Islam. You can argue that I was already influenced to be a Muslim to begin with, and that's fair. I call myself a convert because my experience was much more akin to a convert than to someone who was a Muslim as a child, then drifted far away from it, than came back later in life. I can go into that differentiation if anyone is interested.  A few talking points that I can offer due to some life experiences as opposed to the average Muslim on Reddit:  2. I never dated my wife prior to marrying. In fact, we exchanged 2 emails and spoke for ~15 minutes then tied the knot the following morning. Happily married for 2 years with a 3 month old son 3. I've always been fairly involved in the local Muslim community, and the Muslim community at large in the US. I can offer insight into the many societal problems Muslims face here in the US. I've worked at a Muslim elementary a year, I've dedicated years toward building a private Muslim high school. 4. I often work with the youth groups in the area, it's very common to speak with late teen/early 20's and discuss doubts over the controversial topics (gender inequality, age of Aisha, etc)  That being said, also happy to go over some of the more common, day-to-day questions that I get from co-workers and non-Muslim friends  1. What' the difference between ""Islam"" and ""Muslim""? 2. So what does the Qur'an say? 3. What made you convert? 4. What made you beieve in God? 5. Where do you get your ritual behaviors from? 6. Why do you have a beard? Why not a turban? 7. Isn't your wife hot in that headscarf? Why doesn't she wear the face mask thing but her sister does?  I can also talk about some of the hardships of being a Muslim in the US, and some things that you can consider for the sake of strengthening your relationship with your Muslim coworker/neighbor/friend/acquaintance. Few examples:  1. We have our own version of kosher (referred to as ""halaal"" or ""zabiha"") regarding animal slaughter. We also have other dietary restrictions that are worth considering if you're inviting a Muslim over for dinner 2. I don't shake hands with women, my wife doesn't shake hands with men. It's tricky in the working world. 3. I don't have any female friends, I don't hang out with the opposite sex.  4. I keep a beard, I haven't shaved/trimmed in 3 years.

This is probably a case of inventing history in order to account for divergent customs‚Ä¶ According to the context, the distinction is made between Jews of the provinces and Jews of the capital of Susa.  However, the verse introduces a new distinction, viz. [namely], **Jews of the villages, who live in the open towns** and (implicitly) those living in walled cities‚Ä¶ In the course of time the implication of vs. 19 gave rise to elaborate Talmudic discussion as to the difference between an (unwalled) hamlet and a walled city. The rabbis concluded that cities which had been walled since the days of Joshua were under obligation to observe ‚ÄòShushan Purim.‚Äô Vs. 19 is of the nature of a parenthesis, and without it the connection between vss. 18 and 20 is excellent.‚Äù (Anderson, 1956, pp. III 869-870)   &amp;nbsp;      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;&gt;&gt;‚ÄúREGULATIONS FOR THE ANNUAL OBSERVANCE OF PURIM (9:20-10:3)‚Äù (Anderson, 1956, p.

The difficulty arises out of the uncertainty as to the subject of the clause.  Since the subject is feminine in the Hebrew (lit. [literally] ‚Äòshe came‚Äô), many translators‚Ä¶ find in the feminine subject a reference to **Esther**.  It would be fitting to introduce the heroine into the recapitulation of the plot, but since Esther is not mentioned in the context (she is last mentioned in 9:13) this translation is unnatural.  Some modern translators‚Ä¶ treat the feminine as a neuter ‚Äòit‚Äô or ‚Äòthis,‚Äô i.e., [in other words] the matter of Haman‚Äôs conspiracy which came before the king at Esther‚Äôs second banquet.  This interpretation has the approval of many scholars.  However, it rests upon a translation which is questionable (‚ÄòThis is hardly Hebrew,‚Äô says the eminent Semitist, C. C. Torrey).‚Äù (Anderson, 1956, p. III 871)   &amp;nbsp;     ‚Äú***With the account***, is reversed [◊ô◊©◊ï◊ë, *YahShOoB*] his thought,    the evil, that he thought upon the YeHOo-DeeYM, upon his [own] head.

III 871)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;I miss the difficulty Anderson has with this verse; Queen Esther comes before the king, and he says ‚ÄúWith the account‚Äù, that is the report of events, what Haman imagined upon the Jews has come to him instead.   &amp;nbsp;    -26. Therefore [◊¢◊ú ◊õ◊ü, *`ahL KayN*] they called to days the these POoReeYM,    upon [the] name ‚ÄúHahPOoR‚Äù,    therefore upon all [the] words of **the message** [◊î◊ê◊í◊®◊™, *Hah‚ÄôeeGehRehTh*], **the that**,    and what they saw upon thus [◊õ◊õ◊î, *KahKhaH*],    and what arrived unto them.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúThe explanation and authorization of these two days (cf. vs. 27) has been the governing purpose of the book from the outset.  **This letter**: Mordecai‚Äôs festal letter mentioned in vs. 23.‚Äù (Anderson, 1956, pp. III 871-872)   &amp;nbsp;    -27.

And the days the these are remembered and done in every generation and generation, family and family, state and state, and city and city,    and days of the POoReeYM the these will not be passed over from within the YeHOo-DeeYM,    and their remembrance will not end [◊ô◊°◊ï◊£, *Yah√áOoPh*] from their seed.   &amp;nbsp;    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;&gt;&gt;‚ÄúESTHER ADDS HER AUTHORIZATION (9:29-32)   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;‚ÄúIn this section the Hebrew text is not beyond suspicion.  The question arises as to whether this new letter was sent out by Esther alone or by Esther and Mordecai jointly.  In vs. 29 Esther and Mordecai are coauthors, but in vs. 30 the verb is masculine singular‚Ä¶. it is best to follow the M.T. [Masoretic Text, the standard Hebrew Bible] (so LXX [the Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible] in vs. 30) in regarding this as a joint letter.‚Äù (Anderson, 1956, p. III 872)   &amp;nbsp;    -29. And wrote, ‚Äôeh√áThayR, the queen, daughter [of] ‚ÄôahBeeYHahYeeL [‚ÄúMy Father Soldier‚Äù, Avihail], and MahRDahKhah-eeY [◊ê◊™, ‚ÄôehTh] the YeHOo-DeeY, [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] all authority [◊™◊ß◊£, *ThoQehPh*], to realize [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôayTh*]  **message** [of] the **POoReeYM the that, the second**.   &amp;nbsp;      &gt;‚Äú**This second letter about Purim**: To what does **second** refer?  Usually it is taken to refer to the joint letter which is described in vss. 29-31.  But it would seem strange for Esther and Mordecai to write to confirm their own letter, and furthermore it is stated explicitly in vs. 31 that the purpose of the joint letter was to give additional confirmation to Mordecai‚Äôs previous festal letter.‚Äù (Anderson, 1956, p. III 872)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;I think it is a garbled reference to the fact that there are two separate dates for observing Purim.   &amp;nbsp;    -**30**. And he sent accounts unto all the YeHOo-DeeYM,    unto seven and twenty and a hundred state[s] [of] [the] kingdom of ‚ÄôahHahShVayROSh,    words of peace and truth,    -**31**. to realize [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôayTh*] days of the POoReeYM, the these, in their times,    as that realized upon them, MahRDahKhah-eeY the YeHOo-DeeY, and ‚Äôeh√áThayR the queen,    and as that realized upon their soul and upon their seed,    **realized words of the fasts and their outcry** [◊ï◊ñ◊¢◊ß◊™◊ù, *VeZah`ahQahThahM*].   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**With regard to their fasts and their lamenting**: Many commentators believe on the basis of this phrase that the purpose of the joint letter was to introduce fasting as an essential part of the festival, and that this verse thus gave a legal precedent for the custom, which developed probably about the ninth century A.D., of observing the thirteenth of Adar as ‚ÄòEsther‚Äôs Fast‚Äô (cf. 4:16).‚Äù (Anderson, 1956, p. III 873)   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú**30-31**. The tedious repetition of ‚Äòdata‚Äô about this feast strongly suggests a later date for vv 20-32.‚Äù (Demetrius Dumm, 1990, p. 579)   &amp;nbsp;    -32.

I'm new to this and still trying to figure things out. As a marxist who views capitalism as an exploitative system why doesn't god help us move to a better society? (I think this question I think also applies to racism and cis-hetero patriarchy) I understand the argument that we have free will and god isn't going to stop us from making decisions that harm each other, but capitalism, racism, etc. All seem like systems that aren't based on individual choices really but more systemic so I don't really think that argument applies.  Anyway I'd love to here everyone's thoughts on this.","What we're looking at here is a variant on the Problem of Evil. I'm going to restate this problem in its more standard form, not because I expect you've never heard it, but because it will be relevant to my point.  1. God is all good, necessitating opposition to evil/suffering.  2. God is all powerful.  3. Evil exists.  There have been countless arguments against this Problem (in theological terminology these are called ""theodicies,"" justifying the ways of God to man) throughout the ages. The free will one you alluded to, soul-making (basically people *need* suffering in their lives for their self-improvement to be worth anything), the best of all possible worlds (God couldn't have created a universe that was any better than the one we currently have), the ultimate harmony (that the suffering in question is necessary for some yet-unknown good further down the line in God's plan; this tends to be what's implied when people use the phrase, ""Mysterious ways""), and so on and so forth. I'm not particularly satisfied by any of these, as they all have logical gaps and leaps.  The Book of Job is often called a text that answers the Problem of Evil, which is a rather poor reading of it. For one, God *never* offers Job an explanation for why all of these misfortunes have happened to him. We the readers are privy to the conversations God has with the satan, but Job never is. I honestly don't think we're meant to understand the scenes with the satan as the big ""Why"" of the story, partially for this reason and partially because the satan is not Satan as many modern readers will think of him. He's just an angel with a particular job. So there's no cosmic enmity on-display here. God even says in Ch. 2 that *he* is directly involved in Job's misfortunes, not that he is simply stepping back and allowing a malevolent figure to act on him.  Instead I think the answer the Book of Job gives is the shocking, ""Look at how much bigger the entire universe is than you. You are so small in the grand scheme of things, how do you think you could possibly comprehend what's going on here?"" Put another way, there is no cosmic justice, not humanly understandable justice anyway. However we should still hold to our morals and act justly regardless.  Along a similar track, if we look at the central event of Christian faith, where do we find God? Do we see him ripping apart oppressive systems with his bare hands? Do we see him miracle-Robin-Hood-ing money away from the 1% and into the hands of the masses? Well no. God in that moment is suffering. God in that moment is a condemned criminal.  In my opinion, asking why God doesn't do something about our suffering is asking the wrong question. We should be asking, ""Where *is* God in our suffering?"" and the answer is that he's right there inside it with us.","Hmm that's really interesting and something I need to reflect on myself, would you say that god while in our suffering is also in those who cause the suffering?",comment_1,"Challenges Religious Customs,

I never really get that in my everyday life as I used to, because I would continually let those thoughts come and hold them up; letting them dissolve.     Then I had my second sit.  There was a lot of emotional stuff that came up while I was sitting.  A lot of things I hadn't dealt with anger and feelings I had about the election, my life, and my parents.  I was very surprised when they came out of me.  It seemed like this ethos I've carried of not picking and choosing pooled up this emotion that I was stuffing down.  It really through me for a loop.  I sat and just returned to my breath letting it all bubble up.     What's even weirder now that those things have bubbled up and spilled over into my work.  I came to work and everyone was asking me, 'Are you ok?'  Because I'm usually smiling a lot and I found myself having a really short fuse with people.  I didn't act on that anger towards other, but now it has me self-reflecting.     There is this one other thing and it has to do with this story below.      &gt;There lived once Svetaketu. . . To him his father Uddalaka . . . said: ""Svetaketu, go to school; for no one belonging to our race, dear son, who, not having studied, is, as it were, a Brahmin by birth only""    &gt;Having begun his apprenticeship when he was twelve years of age, Svetaketu returned to his father, when he was twenty-four, having then studied all the Vedas,conceited, considering himself well-read, and stern.    &gt;His father said to him: ""Svetaketu, as you are so conceited, considering yourself so well-read and so stern, my dear, have you ever asked for that instruction by which we hear what cannot be heard, by which we perceive what cannot be perceived, by which we know what cannot be known? ""     &gt;""What is that instruction, Sir?"" he asked. . .    &gt;""Fetch me . . . a fruit of the Nyagrodha tree.""    &gt;""Here is one, Sir.""    &gt;""Break it.""    &gt;""It is broken, Sir.""    &gt;""What do you see there?""    &gt;""These seeds, almost infinitesimal.""    &gt;""Break one of them.""    &gt;""It is broken, Sir.""    &gt;""What do you see there?""    &gt;""Not anything, Sir.""    &gt;The father said: ""My son, that subtle essence which you do not perceive there, of that very essence this great Nyagrodha tree exists.    &gt;""Believe it, my son. That which is the subtle essence, in it all that exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self, and you, . . . Svetaketu, are it. ""       I think this is the real reason why I wanted to get serious about Zazen that creates a space to look at this subtle essence.  This, 'I don't know' or 'nothingness' that I've been afraid of for a long time.  It's like thinking with out the goal of finding an answer. This is what my focus will be moving forward, but trying to penetrate this is what also brought up my anger so I'm not sure what to expect.","Hey good luck man.

A Nato citizen's take on false pretense + propaganda fueled campaigns to secure oil comparing Russian's invastion on Ukraine vs USA's invasion of the middle-east,"I'm a citizen from a NATO country and absolutely denounce Putin's actions in this moment. However after seeing so many passionate Americans discussing this topic I urge you Americans to read this from every other country in NATO's perspective, as many of my European friends know most Americans are all brainwashed the same way:  Talking about the war in Ukraine yes Putin is evil, but extreme restraint has been shown towards inflicting civilian casualties - from the fact we saw that video of a single guy blocking tanks tienamin square-esque, the dude who punched a russian soldier in the face (just to not get punched or anything back but a warning shot into the ground) - the fact 2 of the missiles hitting apartment buildings had mapped trajedectories showing they were near-misses of actual military points of importance, etc are all in favor of the Ukranian people.  Putin's use of artillery has 99% so far been to barrage only military-entrenched positions (some of which sadly are amid civillians, so yes civilian life is being lost, but not targetted - the importance is the targetting of military assets) is something to note.  I hate Putin and hope Russia loses, but If he really wanted mass bloodshed, we'd see artillery barrages over every civillian point of interest to conflict collateral damage to get Ukraine to surrender. Also I come from a NATO country but let's be real here, USA intentionally went into middle-east knowing there were no WMDS and PURPOSELY targeted hospitals, schools, kindergardens etc for 'shock and awe'.  Once again fuck Putin, but atleast unlike the USA leaders, he shows restraint. I hope Ukraine\* wins, but I hope the USA sheeple come to understand just how much propaganda THEY consume (once again Im white and from a NATO country - just saying truths) and maybe wake up to the fact that the USA military is more willing to shed blood, than even the Russian military.  The only difference is the lens upon which the propaganda we're seeing is. Russia is invading Ukraine for oil (it's proven look it up srsly) just as USA invaded middle east for oil. The world is fucked. I wish the American people can come to respect middle-eastern civillian lives as much as Ukrainian lives. Anyways rant over, hoping the best for Ukraine.  To all of you Americans who are going to passionately defend and rationalize every which way killing 100,000+ innocent middle-eastern people PURELY in the pursuit of oil please sit and think to yourself - are you so racist you reckognize Ukranian people as humans but not middle-eastern people? Or are you too stupid and brainwashed to understand the USA government purposely destroys KINDERGARDENS and HOSPITALS to DESTABILIZE regions in the pursuit of oil, where as yes fuck Russia, but they are mostly focused on MILITARY targets, not ""shock and awe"" tactics.  Slava Ukraine! Fuck Russia! Fuck the Americans who are brainwashed!","This were the problem goes. I barely read comments that praised Nato and shit sanctions. Goddamn they better know the whole story and why Putin pretty much feel the risk of being attacked from Nato when WEST Russia is surrounded by them.   Tho I really doubt he'll back out from Ukraine without actually gaining more than he lost.   Also in my opinion, its a small chance that he will use nuclear weapons first unless he really has no other choice (based on being humiliated and such).","Your last paragraph... You do realize Russia did all the same shit? Right? There are four chess boards on the planet, the Middle East, South America, Africa, and the Eastern block. These four areas have been the playground of the East and the West for centuries. Proxy wars fought in these territories so the East and the West don't have to fight on their own soil. This fight is older than the United States.  All I see is more of the same. The eternal battle between the East and the West. The great monkey fight.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.1073542579

Any fellow moderates down here?,"Hi guys, im an aussie moderate down in sydney that can't stand the overwhelming salafist influence in the Islamic groups here. Its crazy imo.  Looking to make some mates. Am i alone down in Sydney or are there more like minded Muslims here? Honestly just seems like bearded bin laden types run the shows in this city","Mate, for reals, where were you 10 years ago when I was still living in Sydney? You're absolutely right, the place is a Salafist cesspit. I have some funny (and scary) stories about being run out of mosques in Lakemba because I'm very obviously not a Salafi. Eventually, I got so jack of it that I bailed and left the country; now I live in Malaysia.   This is all going back at least a decade, but the Al-Ghazzali Centre in Lakemba was very moderate, even pushing liberal. The guy that was running the show, Imam Afroz Ali, was a bit of controversial figure, but I never found out why. There was an exmuslim columnist for the Sydney Morning Herald that had a hard on for Afroz because I think Afroz was too moderate for his liking.  Another very moderate mosque was Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC) building, an old fire station located in Arncliff. Obviously, the congregation was very mixed. Salafis only attended there for Friday prayers if it was close to where they worked, but the imam there used to literally go off his nut at them if they tried any shit. The main imam used to be this little Indonesian man that everyone used to call ""Ustaz Mario"" because he looked like Maria from Nintendo. He'd had too many bad experiences with Salafis and Saudis in the past, so he was very strict about keeping the masjid moderate. Ustaz Mario is a personal friend and we still catch up for holidays every now and then.  I don't think there's anything liberal in Auburn, although the big Turkish mosque there used to be good. I remember once some of the elderly men, guys in there 70s, were trying to purge the mosque of Salafis because they didn't want them misleading the youth. The guy that used to teach Qur'an classes there (I can't remember his name), he looked like a Salafi, but he actually hates Salafis with a passion.  Avoid the Belmore Mosque at all costs. I think I almost got beheaded there once just for being white. The kutbar on  Friday goes for something like 3 or 4 hours, just the imam screaming his head off about whatever, probably jihad. That place needs to be shut down or at least closely watched.",Yeah man its quite unnerving frankly. This is not the Islam I believe in. The Salafis have ruined Islam. They truly are a cancer on the world. I hope I can one day find a place that is predominately moderate/liberal. Down here its just burkas and beards. üò§üò§üò§,comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.8395666903

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_active/DebateReligion.jsonl,DebateReligion.jsonl,7ys8c1,What makes *your* religion the right one?,"This is a question that I have often wished to ask, but never really gotten an answer for. As someone whom is not outwardly really ""part"" of any major religion, and has in fact been critical of religion for most of my life, I have often wondered why people believe their religion is the correct one.   The argument one often gets from a religious person when discussing the topic, is that there *must* be god or creator, just look at the world around you! But, even if we assume that there *is* a god, what makes *your* god the correct one? For sure, the world is beautiful and full of wonders, but who is to say that the will of this creator was that Jesus should be sacrificed for the sins of mortals, or that Fenrir was to be chained until Ragnarok?   Aside from an indescribable ""feeling"" of course.  For my own views on the matter... I have only recently reconnected with my religious side, and so, I have pondered this matter for many hours. I have yet to arrive at a satisfactory answer, for though I believe one thing that seems to be true to me... Someone else undoubtedly believes something different, and their faith is just as strong as mine...  Discuss!","Well you see here, there's this book that tells them that the book is from god, and they also believe that the other holy books are evil.  They are paranoid to question their religion, fearing that their god is watching them think of these sinful thoughts of questioning him and his greatness.  Plus their whole identity is pretty much associated with that religion, I asked a christian  ""Do you actually believe the supernatural claims in the bible and why?"" and they said yes and that they believe it because the bible is ""practical"". They also began to say that science and religion are 2 different things and cannot be compared... Oblivious of the fact that there are scientific contradictions in the bible which can be compared.",There are indeed very many gods - perhaps an infinitude of them.  And thus if we wish to study them - and learn their ways and be like them - we must at times in our practice focus on just a few - or even for a time just one.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/humanism.jsonl,humanism.jsonl,i9v61s,Is this a place for people who believe that humans are good by nature?,"I thought I would do a search for new positive Reddit groups to join, because I want to counter balance the  negativity when I am on Reddit.  Clearly, a LOT of people today believe humans are trash, that they must be controlled, or they will harm others freely.    Some might say this is a leftover of Christianity and other religions, which tend to see the ""flesh"" as sinful by nature.  It also might come from political manipulation(naturally violent humans create a need for strong police/military).  My understanding is that Humanism is based on the concept that humans are born naturally altruistic, helpful, healthy, and cooperative.  Only through trauma, emotional damage, and illness do humans become harmful to other humans.  It is my belief therefore, that the solutions to modern problems: political, environmental, familial, and psychological, are to be found in basing all actions on this principle-- basically faith in the human ability to do good in the world.  An example would be defunding the police and funding outreach workers, therapists, etc, furthering the belief that humans are worth saving, rather than locking away in prison.  So with this in mind, I was skimming this group, looking for this theme.  Fellow humanists, does what I'm saying ring true for you?  Are humans basically good by nature?  EDIT: Thank you all for the responses. After consideration, I don't think this place will be a good fit for me.  I've got a few suggestions of places to explore, I'll try a few.  Take care!","No. Humans are a part of nature. Some humans do good things, some do bad things. There is no innate nature.  Through our actions we can cultivate those positive tendencies, and understand the negative ones in order to discourage or prevent them. That's all.","To start: I am not trying to dissuade you from your point of view. If believing that all people are innately good helps you to be the best person you can, and it leads you to be good to others, then I hope that you keep it. I will just offer my own perspective.   Speaking only for myself, I see humans as naturally human - meaning they are neither naturally/innately good or trash. Partially because I don't know that all people would list the same morals, ethics and behaviors as good or bad (is it good for a human to be ambitious? How ambitious? etc)   I think what humans do have is innate value and potential. Because I think that all humans have innate value, and because I believe that future behaviors are largely predicted by early life experiences (barring some mental or physical illness), I want to do everything in my power to create positive early experiences for as many people as possible because I think that is most likely to bring out the positive aspects of humanity. I try to treat all people as if they have innate value and they don't have to do anything to earn or prove their worth. I try to fight for and vote for systems that I believe will support progress toward those goals. I do these things because it feels like the right thing to do in light of those beliefs. I don't do them because I was told to, or because I think there will be any type of spiritual reward.   I think we end up in the same place, but for me, there is some danger is believing that all people are naturally good. It can end up leading to a lot of mental fatigue and frustration and it sets up situations where you believe a person is acting against their 'nature' - instead of seeing it as a person reacting to their circumstances or systematic failures.   I hope that answered your question and I hope that you find the positivity that you seek.",comment_2,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

Each visit is accompanied by a nightmare involving the death of my pet lizard or the miscarriage of my unborn child. When the mummy speaks I cannot understand him. He either stands over me while I sleep or lies next to me. Any advice will help. I am currently 4 months pregnant with my first child and do not want to be stressed out about this.","Does this happen while you are sleeping and within an hour or so of going to sleep? Are you unable to move? If so this is probably a night terror, which is a psychological thing.   Honestly, I don't disbelieve in demons, but I would be much more likely to believe that this is just a nightmare rather than anything real happening. I've had scary recurring dreams in the past as well. If it happens again if talk to your doctor before a priest.","Likely, the dream is an ""externalization"" of the fears that you carry inside. It is irrational, equally irrational as a mummy that rises again. The externalization is the first step toward removing this anxiety from your unconscious. The demon will likely go away if you decide to stop worrying. The externalization is a sign that it may be removed from your personality. The dream says that the irrational fears are not part of yourself anymore, but only come visiting you. So now they could be cut off completely. This is what exorcists and medicine men have always done, in a ritual manner. But modern people can do it themselves, by an effort of will.  M.

In reading the following, the ""Word"" is Christ.  &gt; 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was fully God. 2 The Word was with God in the beginning. 3 All things were created by him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of mankind. 5 And the light shines on in the darkness, but the darkness has not mastered it.  &gt; 6 A man came, sent from God, whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that everyone might believe through him. 8 He himself was not the light, but he came to testify about the light. 9 The true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not recognize him. 11 He came to what was his own, but his own people did not receive him. 12 But to all who have received him‚Äîthose who believe in his name‚Äîhe has given the right to become God‚Äôs children 13 ‚Äîchildren not born by human parents or by human desire or a husband‚Äôs decision, but by God.  &gt; 14 Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We saw his glory‚Äîthe glory of the one and only, full of grace and truth, who came from the Father. 15 John testified about him and shouted out, ‚ÄúThis one was the one about whom I said, ‚ÄòHe who comes after me is greater than I am, because he existed before me.‚Äô‚Äù 16 For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another. 17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God. The only one, himself God, who is in closest fellowship with the Father, has made God known.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/Reformed.jsonl,Reformed.jsonl,13cf9iz,ELI5 ‚Äî Covenant of Grace Promised vs. Administered,"Posted earlier about some confusion regarding 1689 vs. Westminster federalism, and now have another question regarding the fundamental basis of what the confessions discuss. The 1689 (LBCF 7.3) says the covenant of grace was revealed in the promise of Gen. 3.15 and was made progressively clearer throughout OT history, yet wasn‚Äôt actually established until the New Testament. The Westminster (WC 7.5) says that the CoG was differently administered throughout the various OT covenants, but all those actual administrations are part of the same covenant of grace.  I may be overthinking it, but I genuinely don‚Äôt understand the difference between the covenant of grace being promised vs. administered. If someone could ELI5, that would be much appreciated.","The difference is that in the LBC, there is no covenant of grace until Jesus whereas WCF teaches that the covenant of grace was there in the garden. The payoff is that the LBC teaches Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, etc. we‚Äôre not in the covenant of grace. WCF teaches they were. If none of those men were in the covenant of grace, then none of their covenants are administrations of the covenant of grace, and so the pattens established in them have no bearing on us.  So because we are not in the same covenant as Abraham, it does not matter that his children were in the covenant by virtue of being his children. With this one can then justify Baptist doctrine.","Yes, 1689 Federalism tends towards progressive covenantalism or even NCT.   I am not a fan of 1689 Fed but prefer a 1 substance, 2 admin approach akin to John Gill who is closer to Westminsterianism but saves the Sacraments for those in Christ internally.  ETA- the CoG is how all are saved - God's grace, by union in Christ through faith. Hebrews 2 says OT saints heard the same Gospel we have. Throughout much of the OT, we see God saving for Himself a remnant whose heart would be near Him. Hebrews 11 shows that Abraham and all else were looking forward for a spiritual country.   Example after example shows that the Covenant of Grace - salvation by grace, through Faith, in Christ - has been the way of salvation for all who God calls.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.4087016121

The Devil has killed his parents. The Devil is a Rothschild. The Devil abuses his spouse ...   The religious lot largely say - Devil bad, Purity good. Vice bad, Virtue good.  In another sense, the Devil is the Nietzschean overman, indifferent to morals and imposes his values. In one sense, everyone has excessive desires sometimes.  Why is the Devil prohibited ? This largely  boils down to mimetic imitation. Since the Devil shamelessly follows desires, it would create a mimetic crisis in the society if everyone did that.   The sacrifice of the Devils is practically omnipresent.  Here are the devils I see now, who are being hanged.  1. Harvey Weinstein 2. Louis Ck 3. Julian Assange 4. Dread Pirate Roberts 5.

IMO the Devil, Daemon, Witch or any one of the terms which imply evil attributed to a person, has always been the scapegoat. Christ is another Devil. Christ equated himself to a prophet or a ""God"", crossing the most risque prohibition of all - the desire to play God.  Wherever you look in history, the Devil has always been hanged.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_active/DebateReligion.jsonl,DebateReligion.jsonl,ipdocz,"If our non-material soul can interact with our material brains, then our material to non-material ratio is arbitrary","Let‚Äôs attempt to take the idea that we have non-material souls seriously for the purpose of criticism.   Supposedly, we can see because light enters our eyes, is detected by light sensitive cells on the back of our retina, which are converted into electrical impulses. From there, they travel via our optic nerves and eventually the visual region in our occipital lobe. It is somewhere here that our non-material soul supposedly interacts with our material brains, allowing us to see.   However, if we take this seriously, for the purpose of criticism, our non-material souls could just as well interact with our optic nerves, skipping our brains all together. But we need not stop there. Our non-material souls could interact with the material light sensitive cells on our retinas. In fact, it could simply skip that entire path and directly interact with the photons that enter our eyes. Otherwise, you‚Äôd have to assume there was some external constraints imposed on God which required him to design our sight to work the way it does now. It seems unlikely that theists here would agree that God was under any such constraints.   Now, let‚Äôs look at the idea of the soul from _this_ perspective. Note how, out of all those options, it just happens that God chose to have our non-material souls interact with the most complex, least understood part of our material bodies: our brains. Which, also just so happens to corollate with there being no non-material soul at all. Alternatively, had God decided to have our non-material souls interact with our optic nerves, people who have damage to the connections to their brains could still see. The same can be said if our souls interacted with light sensitive cells on the back of our eyes if the nerves themselves were severed.   In fact, it‚Äôs unclear why our non-material souls would _not_ interact with our material optic nerves, etc. given that it supposedly can interact with our material brains. No _necessary_ constraint prevents this from happening, which would allow people with those issues to see.   In addition, proponents of the no-soul theory would have to propose some alternative way to explain this, such as our optic nerves or light sensitive cells also act as some kind of wireless network to our brains, which would be testable. But, apparently, God decided against that, for some mysterious reason, despite it being an option at his disposal.   Furthermore, this is not limited to our sight. Similar options would have been available for speech, hearing, motor control, touch, etc. IOW, if God is not under any such constraints, our entire material to non-material ratio is arbitrary. There would be no _necessary_ reason why it happens to be the way it is. And, yet, in every case, God supposedly chose to have our non-material soul interact with the most complex, least understood part of our body: our material brains.   Why is that this case? At best, you can say, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how God must have wanted it.‚Äù, which is a bad explanation.  Edit:   To summarize....  -	God would have had a vast number of options at his disposal for how our supposed non-material soul interacts with our material bodies -	A vast number of those options would have posed significantly more problems to the idea that we lack non-material souls than others -	God just so happened to pick an option that poses the least amount of problems for the idea that we lack non-material souls    Did God simply not take this into account when designing how our non-material souls interact with our material bodies? Was he blind sided by the effect of his choice?  Edit: corrected the location our visual processing center in our brains.  Edit: I've provided an analogy that illustrates this further [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/ipdocz/if_our_nonmaterial_soul_can_interact_with_our/g4xvpk0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).","COMMENTARY HERE: Comments that purely commentate on the post (e.g. ‚ÄúNice post OP!‚Äù) must be made as replies to the Auto-Moderator!  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Surely if the soul interacts with the brain at all we can detect the physical changes in the brain. Otherwise does it count as interacting?

The Gemara says what's proper for it, not what's not proper for it.  Lmitei mai, what does this exclude?  Rav Papa says: this excludes kamtzin, mincha offerings, that weren't put in a kli shares, a vessel that you put it into to prepare it for the Mizbeach.    Maskif loy Ravina, Ravina asks: What's the difference with how Ula rules?  Ula said: If Eimirim are put up on the Mizbeach before they sprinkle the blood, they don't take it off, because it's like food for the Mizbeach.  The Gemara explains: Eimirim aren't taken down from the Mizbeach because there's nothing missing.  The Kemitza, the mincha handful, is taken down because it's missing being put in a kli shares.    The Mishna said, R' Yehoshia says: Anything that's proper for the fire.  R' Gamliel learns this from the verse ola al mokdah, the burnt offering on the firewood.  He says: This means that if an ola flies off the Mizbeach, we put it back.  And from where does R' Yehoshia learn this?  Because it's written asher tochal haeish, what has fueled the fire belongs on the Mizbeach.  R' Gamliel says that this verse means that an ola is put back on the fire but ketores isn't.  R' Chanina bar Minyomi agrees.  R' Yehoshia says: it teaches both.  R' Gamliel said in our Mishna, Any Kodshim proper‚Ä¶ so how does R' Yehoshia explain ""Mizbeach""?  It tells us what is mekadesh that which is ruoy for the fire, that is, the Mizbeach is mekadesh.  R' Gamliel says, we learn that from kol hanogea bamizbeach yikdash.  R Yehoshia says that one verse teaches about Kodshim that were at one point ruoy and the other teaches about Kodshim that were never proper.  R Gamliel says that the Torah permits offering sacrifices that are pasul so there is no need to distinguish.  R' Shimon said in the Mishna, whether the korban is kosher...  The Mizbeach is mekadesh an ola.  An ola is offered because it's an ola.  The Mizbeach is mekadesh because it's the Mizbeach.  This excludes accompanying nesachim.  R' Yosi haglili says, maybe ""kol hanogea"" applies even when something isn't ruoy for the Mizbeach.  But we learn ""kevasim"", it's only mekadesh things that are ruoy, like kevasim, lambs.  R' Akiva says ""ola"" teaches that the Mizbeach is only mekadesh what's ruoy, like an ola.  What's the difference between these two views?  R' Ada bar Ahava says they differ regarding olas haof.  R' Akiva includes it from ola, and R' Yosi haglili excludes it from kevasim.  What does R' Yosi haglili learn from ""ola"", then?  If it only said kevasim, one might have thought that it is mekadesh animals that are still alive.  Ola teaches that they have to be sacrificed first.  What does R' Akiva learn from ""kevasim""?  If it only said ""ola"", maybe we would think it could be mekadesh menachos.  It says kevasim so we know it has to be an animal.  How do the tanaim differ from the Mishna?  Rav Papa says, the disagreement is regarding a kemitza that was put in a kli shares.  Reish Lakish says, the tanaim in the Mishna say that if it's by itself, we don't take it down.  The tanaim in the Beraisa say we take it down.","While I unfortunately have no useful input on this subject, I'd like to offer a snippet of what Google Translate pulled out of your submission:  &gt;Rav Ada bar forbidden love burnt chicken Binyehu Some say I was her superior, Mr. and Mr. Wellman was a sheep had imagined Compactors dictated spelling is not typographical sheep  Compators dictated spelling is not typographical sheep.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/Quakers.jsonl,Quakers.jsonl,idmt91,New to Quakerism,"Hello, all.  I've just recently stumbled upon Quakerism as a religious movement online. I had heard of them before but only ever knew them as something akin to the Amish (i.e. an outdated, technology-shunning and insular community unavailable to outsiders). I've obviously since figured out that this couldn't be further from the truth. I was raised an Evangelical and have been quietly agnostic for about the past 5 years or so (I'm 20). I've always had an interest in other religions, and I've found aspects of Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and more that I like and feel a calling towards, but the Christian framework and the Bible have always seemed to keep a hold on me. I struggled to reconcile this with my hatred of the ""religious"" Right in this country, but I still found myself picking up the Bible on occasion and feeling a spiritual fulfillment in Jesus's demands to give help to the poor, love thy neighbor, etc. Since finding out about Quakers and their beliefs, it seems very in line with what I already believed, but with a community of believers that I have been without since my departure from the religion of my parents. I would really like to attend a meeting, but I'm sure with COVID, my local society of friends isn't doing them.  I guess my point is, where do I go from here? Does anybody have any advice or resources for someone just dipping their toes into it that can't attend a meeting? I'd like to continue down this path, but I feel like I need to do more than watch videos about it. If this kind of post is against the rules, I apologize. Thank you for reading anyways.","Hello!

Christians: some congregations lift their hands when praying, because in the O.T. that's what Moses did; the sign of the cross, etc  Jews: the infamous ""Spock"" sign, i.e. the Cohen's blessing; (others?)  Hindus and Buddhists: a variety of mudras (although I still have to understand what they mean...)  And so forth.... any input?","In Zen, we're not super interested in symbolic meanings and stuff, and so with most of the different gestures you'll come across, you'll find a tacit understanding that their performance has some beneficial effect upon the mind, but not much in the way of explanations of what they really ""mean.""  For example, the traditional bowing gesture, with hands palm-to-palm in front of the chin, has a kind of collecting, gathering, unifying effect, as well as expressing some kind of stability, balance, and concentration. This gesture is actually considered a type of practice, although ideally it's done without any ideas of gain -- it's just done.  A Zen teacher I know, when asked ""why do you do that bow?"" answered immediately by simply bowing. He then talked a bit about it... but without saying much. It's just what it is, no need to explain or make up theories.","That's awesome - really! thanks for that!  Would you bow and close your eyes?

I've had this dream several times through my life, with some differences, but it always involves the same setting / woman , only the actions I take in the dream and the feelings are different each time.  I first had this dream when I was very little and it used to happen very often. It involved me walking through a forest (sometimes everything was black/grey and other times dark green tones) and a female silouette would appear between the trees. Sometimes I would try to reach her, as if meeting her was really important and I would feel a terrible loss after waking up. Other times I was deeply terrified of her, but in the dream I did not want to run away.  A couple of nights ago I dreamt of her again. I walked through this forest and then started to carve a statue out of a bright stone - the statue turned out to be this woman with long hair and beautiful features, but I was scared of her stare and her presence. Then, as I was finishing the statue, deer skulls and dead deer started appearing at her feet - I was very distraught for these creatures and just cried, but I could feel her anger as if this was my fault.  I know dreams can be just dreams but I somehow feel this entity is important and I wonder if it could be a deity. I'd love to hear someone else's thoughts!

I‚Äôm not sure myself since I was not very far into the book so I don‚Äôt know if I should continue or abandon?   BTW could anyone that read Keepers of the lost cities tell me if they are appropriate for christians. Thanks!,"Personally, I'm of the opinion that if a fantasy series for children is enough to shake one's faith, then one's faith wasn't built on anything solid to begin with. HDM is a series that critiques religion - to some extent, Pullman was approaching it as a sort of anti-Narnia - but encountering ideas you disagree with isn't a bad thing, imo. You can read it, see what you think of it, and then move on. Our fathers and mothers in the church, true doctors of the church like St. Augustine and St. Catherine of Siena, could never have learned and written the things they did without having considered ideas contrary to their beliefs.   For me, I stopped reading the books because I found Lyra utterly intolerable, but I've read commentaries on the books and have plenty of friends who are both religious and HDM fans. There are multiple ways to read the ""anti-Christian"" aspects of the series, from a full-on ""religion is the opiate of the masses"" approach to a ""this is essentially what Vatican II existed to do in the Catholic Church"" approach to a ""it's a fictional story and the religion depicted isn't the faith I practice here in the real world"" approach.  There's no one right answer - with a good book (including *the* Good Book), I don't think there ever is. Ultimately, you should do what you think is best for you! I just caution anyone who thinks being a Christian means they have to close their ears to contrary opinions. God is bigger than a book with magic compasses and animal souls.",Thanks! üê±,comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.4106415673

Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  Mainstream Christianity teaches not to follow all of the old testament commands, however Jesus appears to differ.","Christianity since the beginning (see Acts) , makes a necessary distinction between the types of Laws and the fact Jesus fulfilled them. For example.  1. Ceremonial Laws (sacrifice this animal this many times for forgiveness of sins).  Jesus is our sacrifice, once and for all. He did not abolish the ceremonial laws, they are just no longer required aka fulfilled.  2. Israel Theocratic Laws (Laws God gave the nation of Israel and held them too to ensure the coming Christ)  Christ came, so there is no need (or actual) theocratic nation of Gods people that must remain pure for the coming Messiah. The laws have nothing to apply to and are fulfilled and no longer needed.  3. Moral Law (Gods commands place on all people that reflect Gods character and is for all human flourishing) Christ came to free us from the penalty of failing at these laws. Now we can walk in them free from the fear of failing and knowing that we now do them out of love for Christ, who kept the law perfectly on our behalf. See Ten Commandments and other commands given by the Apostles or other nations apart from Israel that were held to a specific standard.","These seem like really good answers, but I htink it would be beneficial if you can give specific passages where people can verify your understanding.

Brigham Young ended up winning the majority of the followers during that time and they migrated out west. However, there were several other claimants to being the successor of JS and they stayed (generally) in the midwest. Joseph Smith himself declared that his son JS III would be his successor but he was only a child in '44. In 1860 (30 years after the Restoration and 16 years after JS's death) the church became Reorganized under the leadership of Jospeh Smith III, who became prophet and president of the church. The people who remained in the midwest and many other who initially followed many of the other successors but became dissatisfied ended up joining the Reorganization as well.    &gt; and why do you believe the side that you do?  I'm actually a recent convert and I have my own reasons that are unique to myself. Everyone should have their own reasons for joining the CofC imho","Joseph Smith, Jr.'s death in 1844 caused a great splintering.  There were many groups one of which followed Brigham Young was the largest.

Joseph Smith III, who became a lawyer by training, became president/prophet of the Reorganization in 1860, and served for 54 years.    Today's Church is largely unconcerned with justification or defense of our history, but is concerned about how best to collectively and individually respond to Christ's call for us to love and care for His Creation.

I'm aware that many (but not all) in the early Church were pacifists - though certainly there were centurions and active military in the Roman ranks as well.  Obviously the Just War Theory arose with Constantine and Christianity's explosion of growth  When I see the war in the OT and the absence of direct calls for pacifism throughout the Word, I view Christian pacifism with some skepticism.  Don't get me wrong - I think pacifism is compatible with Christianity, just not a moral mandate.  I respect individuals like Tolstoy and various Christian peace churches, however, I believe Jesus only asked us to engage in non-violence within our communities.  As a result, he definitely taught to avoid confrontation and revenge in everyday life, but he never once rebuked a centurion for his very lifestyle even though he had many opportunities.  Furthermore, we know from Romans 13 that the State has the right to punish evil-doers.  In order to carry out justice, it requires police, and police must use force (violence) to arrest serial killers whom are unwilling to head to prison.  Similarly, a military must use force to protect the least of us from genocide.  I think there are many non-violent options to protecting people, but at the end of the day, non-violence could not have stopped the Third Reich from destroying all that is right and good in this world","Christ's ethic of pacifism, as seen in the Sermon on the Mount, involves unending forgiveness, a willingness to turn the other cheek, a willingness to ""suffer evil"".   What Christ calls for in the Sermon on the Mount is so extreme, as to not be possible. (Do you cut off the part of your body that causes you to sin?)  But, at the same time, can we dare ignore it?  Since it is so extreme, it is an impossible ideal for a society.  Yet, it is a powerful ethic calling on police to seek ways to solve situations without violence, calling on nations, societies, and individuals to live in peace, calling on people to tolerate, forgive, love and accept those who are different.   Christ also refuses to punish, but rather Christ stands up for the criminal, including the adulterer in John 8, the thief dying beside him on the cross, and even Barabbas the murderer set free in his place.  I see this as a call to reevaluate how we think about and treat criminals.   Non-violence and non-punishment need to be held up as way of life, and taught in our churches and our schools.","I'm not arguing against the idea of non-violence as a preference, but you agree that sometimes use of force is necessary to stop evil, no?",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.1526031588

Just a few reasons to start but ultimately as the pastor you‚Äôre in charge of worship so if you think tis appropriate, your community would respond well to it and your worship leaders can do it, than you can do it.","For most of the PC(USA) churches I have been in that don't use CCM, they have never used it. In the 60's-80's it might have been a controversial and intentional decision not to use ""praise songs"" and to stick with hymns, but most of the worship wars have fizzled out by now. Some churches use only CCM, some use a mix of hymns and CCM, and some use only hymns. It varies widely by region. There are a few songs in our hymnal that come from older CCM, so the line between hymns and CCM is not really a neat one.  I don't think it's a trend of rejecting CCM, it's just a choice to continue using our hymnal as a primary source (our hymnal was updated a few years ago and is quite good as far as hymnals go). CCM just isn't the assumed norm like it is in non-denom circles.  There are PC(USA) churches here or there still trying to create a ""contemporary"" worship service, often in addition to and not in replacement of a ""traditional"" worship service. Sometimes it fits the diversity of music preference of the people in the church, but often the debate is less about the music style and more about envy of non-denominational churches. The argument goes, if megachurches (or the large local non-denom) can fill their sanctuary with young people using CCM, maybe your local mainline church would grow if it just used CCM. The problem with the argument is that it is driven by a consumeristic mindset. It will only reward the church that can offer a superior product in a competitive environment. It's usually not just about the music, but all of the other perks that the local megachurch can offer their members.  As a pastor, I think it is important for a church to follow where they hear God calling them more than they follow trends. That involves using the music that most resonates with the congregation. Sometimes that means CCM, but sometimes it means hymns. This was once a very generational debate, but has become less so. CCM in general developed as a boomer based movement and by the time we get to millennials at least, there is not a strong preference in music style as a deciding factor in church membership.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.8621145765

It was very unexpected but exactly what I needed.  Now, I work with and/or worship five Goddesses and four Gods, but I also honor many others at different times when it feels right. Aine, for instance, or Vishnu.   I'd pick whoever seems to be a potential fit and approach them. It might not last or work out, and that's okay. You won't be punished for exploring and getting to know them.   One tip I have in this regard. I've found, at least for me, that the deities I have some resistance to worshipping usually turned out to be those I needed most. Some I feel totally neutral about, others attracted to, but the ones I initially shrugged off as possibilities usually became deeply cherished. Humans tend to resist the medicine most right for them, so pay attention to your inner voice for sure!   Good luck üíö",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.3790950924

She is presented as a symbol of the sin of Samaria from which she was born, (?gran-)daughter of Jezebel.  She secured power by a trail of massacres comparable to medieval Marozia‚Äôs enslavement of the papacy.  Athaliah‚Äôs crisis was apparently reached in the same year in which Jezebel was dominating Israel (2 Kgs [Kings] 9:30), *ca.* [about year] 841).

As far back as 2 Kgs 1:17 we see that Judah‚Äôs Jehoram became king while Elijah was still functioning.  It seems likely that Elijah, while roaming about Samaria, Gilead, Phoenicia, and Sinai (1 Kgs 19:8), knew what was going on in Judah and expressed himself about it.  Whether these views were taken down by a disciple and sent as ‚ÄúElijah‚Äôs letter‚Äô during or after his lifetime or were first composed for insertion in Chr is no real problem of historicity.‚Äù (North, 1990, p. 378)   &amp;nbsp;    -13. ‚Äò‚Äúand you go in [the] way [of] kings of YeeSRah-‚ÄôayL,    and you dick [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] YeHOo-DaH and [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] settlers of Jerusalem like the dickings [◊õ◊î◊ñ◊†◊ï◊™, *KeHahZeNOTh*] [of] House ‚ÄôahH‚ÄôahB,      and also [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôehTh*] your brothers, house [of] your father, the good than you [◊û◊û◊ö, *MeeMKhah*], you killed.    -14.

I know no one here knows me but I know some of you just through years of making dozens of accounts and maybe some light history stalking... On to the point though   I'm not sure how relevant this is to Christianity but I feel it's deeply relevant to my faith and I don't know where else to turn.   I'm currently waiting for a disability claim to be processed after a long and arduous fight with them, where they initially modified the time my doctor requested I take off and provided no explanation. I'm expecting a decision on my claim today so first please pray for that. I don't want to mention the condition because I am paranoid and I know these scum will do whatever they can to deny me. I've been almost completely out of money due to the problems above for the past month, and in constant dibilitating pain.   All of this has made me so crushed.

I am wanting to exact revenge on my terrible insurance provider and feeling more hateful / violent than I ever have in my life. I know I need to pray for my enemies and in reality it's not the lowly case manager's fault if I get denied, but it's hard not to feel this way. I am praying for her and the company in general to turn away from their evil that has no doubt led to many deaths (see the recent Bloomberg article regarding insurance claims). But why the fuck does God never respond. I would be more at peace if he just gave me a sign that he truly does hate me.   I'm not a perfect person. Not even a good one. I'm not a good Christian either, only begging for gods help, not attending church or whatever. Honestly I don't know where I'm going with this post. If it weren't for my girlfriend I would be planning my escape from where I live and my suicide. Just pray for me, especially if you're someone God actually listens to. Am I just made to suffer?

I've very grateful for her and the other people that love me in my life.

And yikes was it different from what I expected. I contribute this because you always hear about Christianity being this religion about a loving God that is caring and coddles you and I did not get that at all reading the Bible. Now disclaimer I‚Äôm sure that I could just be interpreting it differently but let‚Äôs get into it.  So first let‚Äôs start with am now officially under the impression that Christianity is masochist. There is just so much persecution and suffering that it gets depressing. Something interesting is that Peter denied Jesus and the way that is framed is that it‚Äôs a best thing. Peter should of got himself captured and killed because of the Gospel, right? Now obviously you could argue that martyr are great people but why is Peter condemned because he was scared? Why did God possible want him being martyred. Sure you could argue that he has plan concerning everybody but does this mean he explicitly creates people that are gonna be martyrs with the intention of glorying him? Anyway heavy stuff but very interesting.  Now we could discuss the whole forgiveness and wrath part of the Bible something confusing is that it displays a wide arrange of things concerning sin. You have examples of mercy like Prodgial son and Jesus fixing sinners once they repent but then you also get things like Ananias and Sapphira being struck down. Is some sin worse than others? Are some given chances of repenting and others not?  Finally suffering. So there are several verses that imply that he could potentially be causing suffering besides simply allowing it. You know active will vs passive will. You also have some Christians that say suffering is essential because it promotes growth and maturity (not always the case but okay) but theoretically couldn‚Äôt God achieve the same results with causing that?  Anyways these were the main questions after reading the Bible. Will be posting this in different sec with the intention of getting multiple opinions.

Doubted making a mistake in one of them? Repeat the action (because doubt = it didn't happen according to scholars) and continue praying. If you didn't repeat the action, the prayer is invalid.  This is a problem for someone like me - I don't have clinically diagnosed OCD - but I take a realllly long time to pray and do wudhu because of these doubts. But I have no idea where the basis for this comes from.   To me, it feels wrong to repeat prayers once you have completed them. I believe Allah knows our intentions, and these constant doubts just drain the Khushoo out of prayer. But where does the evidence for this come from? Are there any scholars that say this should not be the case?  This just makes me feel very anxious, fuelling compulsive actions and makes prayer feel suffocating. I almost have a panic attack every time it's time to pray. Sometimes, I repeat prayers 4-5 times a day to get them ""just right"". Even then, sometimes sleep is my only solution.","It's really helpful to separate out scholars opinions from what is actually explicitly stated.  It is the *opinion* of some scholars to repeat prayers like you are describing.   It is also the *opinion* of other scholars that you can just do 1-2 extra sujoods at the end to make up for any minor mistakes you may have made, which might be a better option in your case.   No need to repeat the entire thing.  See: [Correcting Errors during prayers](https://www.islamiqate.com/3809/how-should-correct-mistake-error-made-during-prayers-salat)  Edit: also, helpful wikipedia article with (as far as I am aware) the most common method of correcting prayers as per the second opinion above, called [sujud sawhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujud_Sahwi). It's easy, just 1-2 sujuds (taking you maybe 10-15 seconds). It should save you a lot of time and stress if you have been repeating entire prayers until now.  In any case, what matters most is your niyyah (intention) in your heart. Allah is the Rahman and the Rahim. Navigating sharia with OCD must be really difficult, but remember Allah made this religion to be easy, gentle, and welcoming.",Thanks for the link! The tricky thing is that this article reinforces what I was asking about. For example: I'm the type of person that often doubts if they sat for long in between two prostrations. This is a pillar of prayer.  So I'll sit for a longer time after my second prostration and then go into a third. The idea of going into a third prostration makes me very uncomfortable because I feel that I am intentionally adding something to prayer and hence invalidating it.

In other cultures there is no awareness of sin. The citizen is viewed as impeccable as long as he/she follows the rules and submits to the [social pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure).  Yet, the awareness of sin is in decline these days. Instead people think they can be ""perfect"" by adopting some [postmodernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) ideology and saying the right things. It implies a regress to pre-Christian morality. In Roman times, perfectness was the ideal, because people really thought they could be without faults. It gave rise to the motif of defending one's honour. Of course, anybody who thinks that he is perfect is also easily offended. This caused a lot of strife in society, and it could even lead to murder. Alternatively, the offended party committed suicide, as in the case of [Lucretia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia).  Augustine attacked this way of thought and explained that no human being can be stainless and free of faults, as we are all polluted by [original sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin). We are easily tempted to do the wrong thing, and much prone to error. In fact, the only way to minimize missteps is to remain self-critical and keep a watchful eye on oneself. The realization that we are all sinful helped to improve the social situation. It also introduced the concept of self-betterment. People who are perfect cannot improve themselves, but a Christian can always seek betterment. This allowed for personal growth, not only in the moral sense.  But today, due to the dilapidation of Christianity, ancient honour culture is on the rise. Postmodernism builds on Rousseau's creed of the [noble savage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage). It means that a human being is complete and perfect in his/her natural state. It causes moral stagnation, because people need not seek improvement, nor must they maturate as human beings. Humanist ideology (""Man is the measure of all things""), arm-in-arm with Islamic honour culture, leads again to continual strife in society.

The fact that these people think that if they didn‚Äôt have this person watching over them that they would go on killing, raping rampages is the most self-damning thing I can imagine. "" - Penn Jillette","A similar quote would be ""If the only thing keeping a person decent is the expectation of divine reward then, brother, that person is a piece of shit.""- Rust Cohle True Detective. Basically what these quotes are saying is that the only reason that people who believe in God do good things or avoid bad things is because they believe they will either be punished or rewarded by a higher power. These and similar arguments say that you shouldn't need a motivation like that to do the right thing, which I is true as there are many people who don't believe in anything beyond the physical world who don't go on murderous rampages, but the issue I have is someone who has this opinion would probably have a major issue if you suggested that we also get rid of any secular reward/punishment system, aka laws and governments.  The arguments presented here basically imply that the vast majority of people are basically good or decent enough that absent any promise of divine punishment they would still avoid doing anything that would be considered a crime. In some cases, it even says that people who have a belief in a divine reward/punishment system are worse because they only avoid doing wrong things because they think they're being watched at all times whereas someone without that belief is actually good because they do it without the belief that their actions will be rewarded or punished by some god. But is that true, though?  I can only speak from the perspective of a Judeo-Christian because that's what I'm most familiar with but not even in the Bible is doing something solely because you think God will see you and smile and you is a good enough reason for doing good. It also says you should do good because you genuinely love other people. Yes, it's true there's a reward and punishment system but that also holds true for a secular government. If you decide to steal something, you will be punished with either a fine or jail time. If you murder, you will be put in prison. True, you may not steal because you truly believe it's wrong or you won't murder because you love your fellow human being but if, one day, you decided to steal some bread because you were really hungry or murder because someone did something that especially incurred your wrath, best believe there will be consequences for your actions just the same as people who believe in God believe they will be punished for their sins.  Would people who have this opinion be okay if we got rid of all laws and rules since any rational person will naturally come to the conclusion that doing wrong things is bad and doing good things is good? For example, say tomorrow stealing stopped being illegal. Now, it's not legal but it's no longer an offense punishable by law so if someone decided to go in the store and take a backpack full of candy and then you called the police on them, the only response you would get would be, ""And the sky is blue. That's two things that we can do nothing about."" But since the majority of people have empathy and are generally nice, this would be a rare occurrence, right? And in the rare cases that it does happen, the person will feel remorseful and return it, right? Now imagine that happened with everything bad thing that's currently illegal from something as small as stealing a candy bar to something as big as raping a little child. Would we just as good without laws against things that are currently wrong and people are mislead in believing that without some kind of divine punishment would we just turn into savages? Or is there something in this argument that I'm missing?  Basically, my entire point can be summed up like this: If we don't need divine punishment/rewards to behave morally, why do we need secular ones? And if we don't need them, what makes secular punishment different? People's behavior is still being monitored and controlled in both scenarios so why is one better than the other?  *Note: I will not be debating the existence/non-existence of God as that's beyond the scope of this particular discussion so any questions or comments along those lines will be ignored.

It's a place to read beautiful books. But that's beside the main point.  The main point is, I've re-edited the **101 Zen Stories**. I've always loved them, but the translation seemed a little dated to me, perhaps even a little clumsy. So I have rewritten them, hoping to clarify them, retain their inspiration, and perhaps even cast them in a new light. Please enjoy, and any feedback would be appreciated.

Thank you kind but silent Zen fans üôè,"Your preface makes it sound like this is a ""rewrite"" of a translation of the Shasekish≈´, which you claim was translated by Nyogen Senzaki and then compiled by Paul Reps in *Zen Flesh, Zen Bones*. Even a random reader taking one look at the first story in ZFZB would see that this cannot be, because a 13th century monk obviously didn't talk about Meiji era university professors. *Zen Flesh, Zen Bones* has some stories from the Shasekish≈´ (mostly not) but is not that work in itself. This ""new edition"", then, consists merely of rewording the translated stories contained in Reps's compilation. This has to be stated clearly.  Pretty much every story in this edition contains ""reinterpretations"" of the events and characters involved, usually for no discernible reason. For example in story 57, this leads to the loss of the cultural background underlying the original dialogue. In the ZFZB version, Hakuin taunts a samurai in a way that is witty and feels authentic as it touches upon the fact that samurai were noblemen and that they attached great ritual significance to their swords. In your version, the samurai speaks a line that has nothing to do with anything, and Hakuin's taunts are basic and uninspired. Or take Story 61, which paints the Emperor Goyozei not as a curious and respectful student as he is clearly shown to be in the ZFZB version, but as an impatient and pompous ass, for no reason.  Although you claim that ZFZB accidentally added ""outdated ideas"", you do not specify what these are and give no explanation regarding how you address them. This is dishonest. It rather seems like you not only added ideas, but also subtracted and distorted many for no good reason at all, although a few stories must have benefited from this.  Muj≈´, by the way, was not a Zen teacher and the Shasekish≈´ would give people looking for short ""Zen dialogues"" a heart attack because most of it isn't made up of such material.

This is my answer to that kind of thinking and to generate a discussion with like-minded individuals about the deeper aspects of being an active contributing member of society and being a non-anything, a simple sojourner.            This recent news item about atheist communal activity, does it point up a deep human need to socialize as a community?   Do individuals need to have union with a multitude of people in mutual trust and common cause?  Is this the atmosphere where those with questions can come to discuss their feelings and thoughts and possibly find answers?  What is the emotional, spiritual link that people need, and feel they must have?    Is the congregation the engine of our society? If so then inquisitive thought is the lubricant.  Can the deeper questions on morality and the meaning of life then be explored from within the security of a congregation of open, like-minded individuals?  Is it that extended family a congregation provides that important?  Or is it a deeper, emotionally based itch that we‚Äôre trying to scratch? Why are we here? What is life?  Sine there are no easy answers, quite often humans reach a point where they fold their hand and join the sheep. Or like my fellow sojourners we become aware, and are willing satisfied to be among the sojourners, omnivore predators of awesome power.     So that brings us to what it we will base our moral character on? Where will we draw our ethics from? Ethics do not require a deity!  That belief in a deity is a basic requirement for morality is ludicrous.  In the world before the age of enlightenment, belief in a deity correlated to ethical, moral behavior and this foundation of deity belief is still promoted by religious leaders today pushing the church as a moral institution, but it is demonstrably untrue.  Studies have consistently shown that secular societies have lower violent crime rates, lower teen pregnancy rates, and higher rates of education.  Internationally, compare the secular nations of Europe to a religious society like the United States.  Domestically in the US, compare religious states to secular and in any analysis, the secular democracies produce the most socially desirable outcome.  People are not moral out of fear of damnation or eternal punishment or to seek eternal reward.  To say so ignores reams of data that show ""ethical"" behavior - traits like empathy and compassion are an innate makeup of the behavior of many animal species.   I‚Äôd love to keep this real short and real simple; however, it‚Äôs a complex question, it‚Äôs based on my observations over time, a long time.  The backbone of this question is that there exists a plethora of reasons, emotions, and needs that bring together these groups of non-logy/theist/oxymoronists (sojourners).  And in every sojourner‚Äôs sack there are questions.  What drives my future?  Where do I belong? To whom will I turn to for moral support, for my tag-team relief when my Ka needs ministration?   I come to you as a sojourner to present this question for discussion.  I have thought deeply and at length about this bit that I‚Äôve submitted.  I don‚Äôt have an issue with being a sojourner on this earth, this lifetime assignment, I‚Äôm making the most of it, and surprisingly, I‚Äôm quite happy with where I am.   I want to move on along rather quickly now and I want you to stay with me, there is a lot here we can come back to and discuss at length.  In order to follow with me, I ask that you consider the ways of the iconoclast, existentialist, and anarchist because you will need them.   People coming together in an atheist church, ‚Äúatheist church‚Äù makes me laugh every time I say it. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need no churches!‚Äù   We need community meeting houses, I don‚Äôt care for the word ‚Äúchurch‚Äù, it drives people away.  I would like for people to have a place that isn‚Äôt a Unitarian loft of wannabe believers, afraid that there really is a hell and now that‚Äôs where their headed.     The community meeting house should be a place where individuals come together to share their moral and physical efforts and achievements in a spirit of cooperation.  That can only be generated when a group of individuals willingly work together for a goal that is both individually and collectively beneficial.  That is a mark of social accomplishment and wellness.    In today‚Äôs society, anarchy, iconoclasm, and existentialism have come to signify elements whose desire is to destroy that-which is established, constructive and operational, replacing it with chaos and unbounded hedonism.  Hold on!  These words have much broader meanings, and most people using these terms don‚Äôt even know the other definitions exist.    The original definition of anarchy isn‚Äôt to summons chaos; it means being able to live together without excessive government structure, (high moral fiber) it is truly an open and free society.  An existentialist is an individual that believes each of us should conduct ourselves in an ethical manner, and not burden society with our maintenance and care, while thoughtfully contributing to the overall welfare of our society, not a believer in unbridled pursuit of pleasures.  A true existentialist will also examine the moral code of their society and reject ideas and concepts that are not relevant to the wellness of the social structure.  That is where the iconoclast comes in because the sojourner who is looking for answers and a foundation must challenge traditional beliefs, customs, and values in order to provide their personal understanding of life a foundation for their moral structure, where personal integrity and mutual social support are paramount for the individual and the society to survive.  I don‚Äôt need or want a deity, and while I don‚Äôt agree with everything everyone else does, and they don‚Äôt agree with me, at a community level we share the need to be  supported by some rational concept that we can point at and say, that‚Äôs mine, that‚Äôs my people.  I write this in support of the community meeting house, and toward strengthening the individual moral fiber of our people and creating a rational society in our nation.  That is what I‚Äôm shooting for, that level of understanding.     Let‚Äôs add a couple of other words while we‚Äôre at it.  Let‚Äôs throw in realist and agnostic.  As a realist, I fully understand that we are not going to have a major shift in the attitudes of people, we are a lost society with a false economy based on the value of scraps of paper, a third rate Para-mutual parlor where we pray to the gods of greed while the litter of lost fortunes clutters the floor and cheap folding chairs hold lost parishioners.    The agnostic in me stood and shook its fist at the heavens and any supreme being running the whole show.  Have you turned your attention away from us?  ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre out there, let‚Äôs get past the ‚ÄòI want to be the center of attention‚Äô, infantile attitude of the Omni-Present Supreme Being and get back to work.‚Äù  No response . . .  Faith my ass, let‚Äôs see some compassion for the beings you put here.     I really only ask a couple of things, one is; that all responses be well- considered, not quick witted snot, and two that nothing be held sacrosanct.  Be willing to discuss that which you hold sacred, prod it make it squeal, pick at it, flip it over with a stick, see if it hisses.","That would be Steve Harvey, the comedian.","Yes, that's the guy.

Absolutely no doubt in his mind that it's just not true. I didn't challenge him directly, but I pressed him for what he thought evolution was. He didn't know what it is or even what it explains. I got all kinds of crap out of him... Evolution is ""with the sun particles coming down and monkeys"" and it conflicts with ""God's creation of the heavens and the earth"" and other crap. Absolutely nothing about inheritance, selection, or variation. It was embarrassing really.  It took a twenty minute metro ride but I think I made him doubt his confidence by making him show both of us how little he knew about what evolution even was. I didn't explain what evolution was to him, I just told him ""that's not evolution, you shouldn't say you don't believe in it when you don't know what it is"" whenever he came up with some other crap. I'm hoping I made him curious enough to seek information himself but I doubt it.  I came home to my apartment and told my new roommate who is doing a masters in cellular biochemistry. I needed to confide in someone! My roommate then begins telling me how ""evolution is just a theory""...  God damn it!

Since the church sustains the first presidency as ‚ÄòProphets, seers and revelators‚Äô is it also safe to assume that they are actively prophesying?  Is there an easy way to see the prophecies that have been declared by modern prophets?","&gt;Is there an easy way to see the prophecies that have been declared by modern prophets?

Almost like it's a corporation and not a church directed by a deity.","I think the most faithful response would be the the changes made by President Nelson are, in fact, the mind and will of God for His church in the current day.  Only our pride insists on seeing something out of the ordinary from prophets or even a ""Thus saith the Lord"".  The changes made over the last year are what God actually wanted and do constitute prophecy.  Even if we view past decisions as mistakes like Race and the Priesthood or Plural Marriage, important changes to the church came about from these doctrines, policies, and practices.  It may take many years before we comprehend the divine plan and objectives that drove changes that might seem like trivial organizational changes to mere mortals.  Humbly following the prophet is what is required.  This way of thinking would probably work well in your Gospel Doctrine class on Sunday.  The obvious problem is that this line of reasoning only works with people who already believe that the ""Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"" is the one, true church with exclusive priesthood authority to perform ordinances of salvation.  This would not at all be compelling to someone who is experiencing a faith crisis or an indifferent person investigating the church.  A journalist would look at President Nelson's changes as a local story largely confined to the LDS believers but basically irrelevant to anyone else.    This also stand in contrast to how prophets in the Old Testament loudly proclaimed the truth at great risk to their own lives.  No LDS leader is standing on a wall risking life and limb like Samuel the Lamanite.  This is not how Noah, Elijah, Samuel, or Isaiah were protrayed at all.  Political leaders of those times might try to kill those prophets.  In modern times [President Trump meets with the First Presidency](https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-leaders-to-visit-with-us-president) in a good natured photo op and none of God's prophets call Donald Trump to repentance for numerous moral violations.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.7668087602

I wonder how as a Peace Church, with roots as Christians who follow the God of Abraham,  we can reconcile all of the violence that God acts through in the Old Testament. There‚Äôs countless examples of God inspiring armies in the Old Testament, the justification of the genocide of the canaanites comes to mind, as does just the idea of drowning and killing billions of animals and children during The Flood. (It‚Äôs not just limited to those two examples) As someone who staunchly opposes violence and considers that a major spiritual ideal, I find it harder and harder to believe that God and the Bible are a good example of Quaker ideals. I‚Äôm interested in two different types of answers‚Äî how do you reconcile it in your faith, and a question for the more Quaker historian types: how did the Christian Quakers of the past decide that God wanted peace if it‚Äôs not shown in the Bible?","It is a clear to me that one of the following must be true:  a) the Old Testament is not accurate b) God is not entirely good (or unable to commit evil) c) God did not ‚Äúdo‚Äù those things (and does not commit acts upon Earth)  Personally, I believe c before even considering the question, making it easy for me to answer.

As a quaker I believe that God does speak to us directly but in my experience God's reason for speaking to us is to guide us closer to divinity and doesn't really have much to do with the physical world. I can't imagine the God I know to call me to war. Obviously my view of God aligns much more with the one described in the new testament, but I have found stories from the old testament that reinforce my beliefs as well.  It was actually Tolstoy who lead me towards the Friends and Christianity and I find his view of this subject pretty helpful. In his view every mystical, magical miracle or act of God in the physical world in both the old and new testaments were added on and embellished over generations before any of it was written down to make these stories more compelling and appeal to an audience whose religious life  revolved around Gods who did affect the physical world tangibly on a daily basis.

I was browsing facebook this morning. I've liked many atheist pages and I was catching up on their shared (and reshared) images and articles. I began to shrug off the bits of sexism I was encountering when it occurred to me: I shouldn't have to. I know these things (list of examples to follow) aren't aggressive or really 'that bad', but they would never occur against men and I'm tired of it becoming commonplace to the point that I don't even notice it sometimes.

Many women object in the comments object. One, in particular, says she loves the page and often finds the images funny, but asks when the owner will post something that aknoweledges and uplifts females in science rather than objectifying them. Every male to respond to any of these women telss them 'it's just a joke', 'don't be so sensitive' or similar. One man unironically posts that the women upset about this image must not be able to watch tv/movies or listen to radio or read books because this type of thing is everywhere.  Page Pass The 28th Amendment - Complete Removal Of The Church From The State posts an article about the Governor of AZ advocating public bible classes. The page author calls her a 'fat sow'.

He refers to her as a cunt, the essence of awful femininity. 2. She is ugly and therefore bad. 3. She is a whore. She has sex (which is amoral, for a woman) possibly for money (which is more amoral).  [EDIT: More examples.  Page Sexy Atheists uploads a cartoon of a woman playing computer games facing away from the viewer in just her underwear. A man voices his opinion ('disgusting'. Fair enough, her room is too messy for him.) After more women comment identifying with the post and guessing the game she is playing, based on the interface, he comments again, telling them to play better games if they want to attract a guy. (Full disclosure on this one, I replied: ""This may come as a surprise, but sometimes we aren't trying to impress you. Sometimes we are just sitting in our rooms playing computer games."")  I feel like it's odd because I think most men in the atheist / skeptic / secular community are for womens' rights and believe that women are equal. My working theory is that it's a matter of internalizing society's view on women, chiefly their primary role as decoration and their amoral sexuality.  Sorry I don't have more examples on hand. THe first has been eating at the back of my mind for a week or so and I just read the second. I may add more as I continue to check through posts.  Anyway, as I said, I would love someone else's view on this.","I think it's just an example of how, godless or not, men view women in our society. In my opinion, they aren't entirely to blame. Many women welcome being valued based solely on their sexuality and body. If ALL women hated being treated that way, then I think we'd have a real case to get upset about. When is comes to the angry comments aimed at the AZ governor, I guess I don't count that as a sexist comment against women. The words he used are just the angry words of an internet troll that happen to have female origins. The words used if the governor were a man wouldn't be called sexist against men. That doesn't mean, however, that I condone the hate speech against the AZ gov. Evil people do evil, good people do good, no matter their worldview. Sadly being devoid of religion doesn't help you become a better person in all cases.","I have to disagree regarding the comments about Jan Brewer. ""Cunt"" and ""vile whore"" are sexist terms. In fact they're two of the most sexist slurs against women. They don't just happen to be words to describe a woman - I could **maybe** excuse the use of ""bitch"" because it's sort of the female version of ""asshole,"" and American slang doesn't have many gender-neutral insult words. But ""cunt"" and ""whore"" are so specifically degrading -- especially ""whore."" One word reduces a woman to a body part, and the other one attacks her sexual behavior -- which is totally irrelevant.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.439330939

Hypothetically speaking if someone ends up living longer than 125 years how would you interpret this verse in light of that event?  2 - How do you interpret the aspect of this verse about God not wanting to put up with humans for more than 125 years given that the Bible teaches that our souls are immortal?  Isn't God going to have to put up with us for forever in Heaven?  I'm really curious about #1 and how Fundamentalists will reconcile that happening.  My first, best guest would be that those who take the Bible as the infallible word of God will assume or come to believe that the person who has lived over 125 years is lying about their age or confused about it and that the documents verifying the age of birth are in error.  But should living past 125 years become commonplace that will become harder and harder to do and the problem with this verse is that there is not much you can do as far as interpreting it in a different way as far as I can see, not without some serious mental gymnastics.  The big issue here being that if the Bible's statement that God will not let us live longer than 125 years is invalidated it is no longer possible to believe the Bible is the infallible word of God - which is the entire backbone of the Christian fundamentalist movement.","Don't you think that this is actually evidence *for* the Bible?

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/bahai.jsonl,bahai.jsonl,148yh2c,Catholic Discerning The Baha'i Faith (and a few questions),"Hello. I apologise in advance for the length of this post. I'm a Catholic, and I still have some questions about the Baha'i Faith. We can get to that soon, but first I'd like to explain myself. As you can read in my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bahai/comments/11tdikc/questions%5C_and%5C_concerns%5C_about%5C_the%5C_bahai%5C_faith%5C_from/), I used to be an atheist, then pagan, and now I'm a Catholic Christian. I'm still looking into the Baha'i Faith, but I have a few problems, both with it and myself. Firstly, I'm worried that I might be looking into the Baha'i Faith as sort of a band-aid on a bullet hole; I've been struggling with sin quite a bit recently (please pray for me) and I'm concerned that I may be subconsciously discerning it not because of anything wrong with Catholicism -- more on that later -- but because of what is wrong with me.   Not to get overly cold and rational, but, as a Christian, I fail to see any actual problems with my current faith, especially from a Baha'i perspective. Baha'u'llah said that it is a very good thing to be a Christian (I forget the exact quote), did he not? It's kind of like Pascal's wager: If I stay Christian and I'm wrong, and it turns out the Baha'i Faith is true, then I'm OK, because Baha'is do not, from what I can gather, believe in Hell as Christians and other religions do, and as aforementioned, Baha'u'llah seems to have nothing but kind words for Christianity. But if I do convert, and then I'm wrong, and it turns out that Catholicism was right, then I am absolutely going to Hell, as I have (according to the Christian interpretation of it) denied Christ, and He will therefore deny me before His Father Who is in Heaven.  This is my main worry. If Adam, Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, and Baha'u'llah (and many others) are all Manifestations of God, then by definition all those others are in the same category as Jesus. In other words, if I believe that, I am saying that Muhammad, Baha'u'llah, Adam, and all the rest, are as much God as Jesus is, correct? That seems like quite the gamble, especially if I turn out wrong and it turns out that Christianity is true. But, if the Baha'i Faith *is* true, then I sort of have (or at least feel I have) an obligation to believe it, no? If the Baha'i Faith is true, I want to be a Baha'i; if Christianity is true, I want to be a Christian. Do you see my dilemma here?  I also still have some questions about the Baha'i Faith, some minor some very important.  - If I become a Baha'i, is it OK for me to wear Christian (and particularly Catholic) things, like a Cross/Crucifix necklace or [St Benedict Medal necklace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Benedict_Medal), etc.?  - On a similar note, would it be OK for me to do Catholic things, like praying to Jesus and praying the Rosary? And how far could it go? Would it be OK for me to, for example, get baptised, go to a Catholic Mass, go to Catholic Confession, and receive the Eucharist, or would that be forbidden? On a lesser note, is it OK for me to watch Catholic videos, podcasts, and the like, if I become a Baha'i?  - Baha'is believe, if I recall correctly, that both the Bible and the Quran is the inspired word of God. So how do people reconcile the disagreements, especially on the big things? For example the Bible is very clear that a) Jesus is the Son of God, and b) He was crucified, died, and resurrected three days later. The Quran, however, denies both of these things -- it says that Jesus was the Messiah, but not the Son of God, because (I forget where but I'm certain it says this) Allah cannot have a son because He has no wife, or something to that effect, which is an interesting point, because the Quran also affirms the Virgin Birth of Jesus.  - On a similar note, Baha'is are forbidden from drinking alcohol, as are Muslims. But Jesus turned water into wine, and told people to drink wine (in Holy Communion) and said that it was His Blood. Again, this seems extremely difficult to reconcile.  - How am I supposed to believe in the Baha'i Faith's authority and in progressive revelation, when Jesus said that the Gates of Hell would not prevail against the Church? Yes, it still exists, but it seems to me Jesus was pretty clear that it was supposed to last until the very End -- the Book of Revelation heavily implies that the Church still exists at the End Times.  - What are Baha'is to make of Eucharistic Miracles that occurred after the Baha'i Faith was a thing? Even other Miracles, like Our Lady of Guadeloupe, occurred after Islam was established, so it seems like a knock against it.  - What is the consensus on images? Are they completely forbidden and interpreted strictly as idolatry (like in Islam) or mostly allowed so long as we don't worship the images themselves (like in Catholicism)?   - Is it a sin to eat food that isn't kosher or halal? The Bible would seem to suggest rather directly that Jesus did away with this.  - Why should I believe that Muhammad and Baha'u'llah are actual prophets and genuine Manifestations of God? I can kind of get behind the idea that Abraham and Moses and the like were ""Manifestations of God"" because they were prophets, I'm extremely skeptical of Buddha (although his teachings seem pretty vague to me), and I have no idea why Krishna, a Hindu deity, would be a Manifestation of God.  - On a following note, why do Baha'is not follow Buddhist and Hindu law? For example, Buddhism prohibits eating meat. As far as I know, the Baha'i Faith does not. Same with Zoroastrianism and other minor religions. It just seems like too much to accept all these religions as divinely inspired.  - How are all religions and prophets correct if they disagree with each other so much?  Answers would be greatly appreciated. Please be kind, as I ask these in good faith, and out of a genuine desire to know the truth. Thank you and God bless.","My dear friend! It is so nice to see you have more question. About 3 month ago there was very interesting thread from your thought provoking comments. I am looking forward to see this new thread,  &#x200B;  from last time:  https://www.reddit.com/r/bahai/comments/11tdikc/questions\_and\_concerns\_about\_the\_bahai\_faith\_from/","The Pascal‚Äôs wager part is not correct. Baha‚Äôis believe in hell but we interpret it differently. We don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a literal place of fire. Instead, the fire is separation from God. Someone who lives a truly Christian life is good, but the Most Holy Book says that good deeds and recognition of the Manifestation of God and obedience to His law are inseparable. One is not acceptable without the other. Faith is incomplete, therefore, without recognising Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah. Paradise and heaven mean nearness to Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah.   A true Christian is a Baha‚Äôi because Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah is the Return of Christ. There is no being wrong by recognising Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah because Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah is Christ. To say you‚Äôre denying Christ by accepting Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah is illogical. You cannot separate the two. Either both are correct, or both are wrong. There is no universe in which only Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah or only Christ is true, as they are both Christ.   There is no gamble as the Baha‚Äôi Faith is the only version of religion that explains the entire scheme of religious history in a way that makes sense. It is the only religion that correctly interprets Biblical prophecies. If the Catholic Church is the only correct church, then you cannot account for the prophecies of Daniel, which lead to 1844, and all the other Biblical prophecies which lead us to Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah. We also cannot then account for the obvious truth of Islam and the proofs of the Quran.  Each religion has its own proof and stands on its own proof.   Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah is the Truth, so it is important to develop a loving relationship with Him. If you have that, you would rather die than deny Him. That‚Äôs when you know you are sure.   We have no problem with the cross, so wearing it is not forbidden, but it is inconsistent in my opinion, as it would give people the impression that you‚Äôre Christian, which would be incorrect. You‚Äôd be a Baha‚Äôi.   Praying to Jesus is fine, but better via Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah as He is the Manifestation for today. Mary can of course help us via intercession, but she isn‚Äôt the ‚ÄúMother of God‚Äù. You could ask her for help, but all Baha‚Äôi prayers, which are written in prayer books, are directed to God. Some mention Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah but address God.   Confession is forbidden in Baha‚Äôi law. Wine is forbidden. So that rules out taking part in the mass. Baptism means joining a church, which isn‚Äôt allowed as you cannot join or be a member of another religion while a Baha‚Äôi. If you become a Baha‚Äôi, you are no longer a member of the Catholic Church. Attending church and Christian activities is fine as long as you don‚Äôt make out that you‚Äôre a member of the church. There‚Äôs no issue with watching things. Baha‚Äôis endeavour to learn as much as they can about other religions and get involved in interfaith activities.   There‚Äôs no space here to discuss this. But if you study the Baha‚Äôi Writings, you will understand there are no contradictions between the Bible and the Quran.   Your point about blood and wine suggests you need to study the Baha‚Äôi concept of progressive revelation more thoroughly.   The ‚Äúchurch‚Äù isn‚Äôt what you think it is. The Catholic Church does not have divine authority. In every dispensation, there is a religious community. In the Christian Dispensation, it was the body of believers called the church (ekklesia). That ceased when Muhammad came, and it was called the ummah. Now, it is the Baha‚Äôi world community. The papacy is not a legitimate institution. It evolved from the bishop of Rome to become something else. The Universal House of Justice, however, is ordained by God and infallible.   Most miracles recorded are fantasies and even if true are only proof for those who view them. God can give miracles to anyone through the Holy Spirit but the majority of such cases are not true miracles per se.   Veneration of images is wrong. The Catholic practice of venerating icons is considered incorrect. We also don‚Äôt depict Manifestations of God or Prophets.   The proofs of all Manifestations are the same, so it is impossible to believe in one truly without believing in all of them. Read the Kitab-i-Iqan and Some Answered Questions. If you recognise Jesus, those same proofs are what would make you recognise Muhammad and Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah. The only difference is that the proofs of Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah are more numerous because of all the prophecies He fulfilled and how recently He lived. His revelation is also more potent than any that came before.   Your question about Buddhist and Hindu law again suggests you still need to investigate the core Baha‚Äôi teachings because the whole Baha‚Äôi Faith circles around the concept of progressive revelation. You need to learn that first in order to understand what the Faith teaches.   The religions don‚Äôt disagree ‚Äúso much‚Äù. They are fundamentally all the same, just suited to a different time. Most of the differences you‚Äôre referring to are man made and don‚Äôt come from God, eg most of Christian theology or the Hindu concept of reincarnation. Neither of those things come from God. So to say they contradict is besides the point. The religion is the divinely ordained part. What you‚Äôre referring to is the man-made shell.",comment_2,"Acknowledges Differing Views,

I would say I believe in a higher power due to what I understand to be conversely unbelievable coincidences. For one, existence itself. Even the most popular scientific theory of the beginning is that our universe... sprung out of nothing? A nigh infinite amount of mass and energy emerged from an infinitely small point, for shits and gigs? Where did it come from? Why did it happen? There has to be something more. That's point one. Point two is the improbability of life, rational beings, springing from the shrapnel of the almighty explosion, but only once, as far as we can tell. Mostly thanks to water. Water, dude? Water is nuts. It breaks so many of the 'rules' for chemicals like it. The surface tension, the boiling point, and I'm pretty sure the way it bonds (or doesn't bond?) with other things are all super important for life as we understand it. I'm just not convinced that this crazy exception to the otherwise very uniform laws of chemistry is random chance. And, moreover, if it were as simple as that I do not believe we were the first or one of so few as to not have discovered one another. My next point is the beauty of our mind. We have become very fluent at the language of the universe, math, and it has allowed us to manipulate the material world to benefit ourselves. We do this on individual and massive scale. When compared to the capabilities and mechanisms of other lifeforms, which already appear to be the work of an architect, what we do is straight up magic. It's insane. And we have the ability to self reflect on all of this. We can continue to better ourselves, not just in the haphazard, stumbling fashion of evolution, but with forethought. Self actualization. We can imagine completely novel possibilities (or impossibilities!) and then set out to make them real. Amazing. I am not a religious person but I find it less likely that all of this is coincidence than it being the caused or influenced progression through some sort of plan or journey or development or experiment. Honestly I've not ruled out the idea that we're in some sort of simulation.

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/humanism.jsonl,humanism.jsonl,2n9nun,Is humanism basically atheism?(read),"So I realize that Humanism places so much more emphasize on people, and I agree totally. Regardless, is it basically to avoid that ""feeling of evil"" (incorrect) from other people? Are you pretty much the same way as me?   Let me clear it up completely: Do you, even if you really care more about people/humans, prefer saying ""Humanist"" so that you're basically not put in that ""evil"" category when some asks? (Downvotes shouldn't be used as ""I disagree""s)","Atheism is *very* simple: most broadly, it is a lack of belief in gods.  *That's it*.   It's not a philosophy or world-view. It has no dogma or rituals or songs or special books. It's just a single position on a single issue.  Humanism, as the sidebar describes, is more of a philosophy and way of living that includes various positions on how to treat one another.  As such, these are not mutually exclusive - you can be one, or the other, or both at the same time.  &gt; Do you, even if you really care more about people/humans, prefer saying ""Humanist"" so that you're basically not put in that ""evil"" category when some asks?   If someone is asking specifically about my religious views, I say that I am an atheist. If someone asks me ""but what do you believe in?"" I answer by saying that I am a secular humanist.   Secular humanism isn't a religion, so if someone asks me ""what church do you go to?"" they are making the mistake of assuming I even go to one, so ""I'm an atheist, I don't go to any church"" is a great way to gently remind people that not everyone goes to a church. Answering ""secular humanism"" to that question would be disingenuous.  Can you clarify what you mean by ""evil category?"" I'm curious what you mean by that.  tl;dr: Atheism is a useful label when talking about my religious views - I'm not a theist. Secular humanism is useful when talking about positive beliefs and morality and philosophy of life stuff.",Nice explanation. I'd also add that there theists that consider themselves humanists as well.   A secular humanist is less likely to encounter scenarios where not belonging to a faith might interfere with humanist ideals. Certain tenets of faith dovetail with humanism (Catholic nuns who protest warfare and aggression) while others (holding a stance against contraception) are points of contention.,comment_2,Respects Diverse Perspectives,,,,,,No,0.7951191292

I know is that Jesus is God; the Holy Spirit is God; the Father is God, and that they the same one and only God.    I know that God, as Jesus, came to Earth, and lived as a human among us.  He was completely human, and yet He was also completely God.  When He died on the cross, He died for me. His act was a ransom for my sins, for which I deserve death, not He.  But He died in my place, so that I might be saved from sin and be able to go to heaven when I die.  I personally accept this gift of His. His sacrifice is something He did for me personally; I offer my willingness to turn away from sin and I accept His Holy Spirit into my heart to help me change.

This is perhaps due to an unconscious association made with the Christian concept of **Caritas**.  &amp;#x200B;  While Metta does imply that we love other living beings ""as a mother would her only child,"" it does not imply that we repeatedly endure wrong done to us over and over and to ""turn the other cheek 77 times,"" as it would be. Nor would it imply that we must be fully passive with an invader attacking our family, for example.  &amp;#x200B;  AN 4.67 Gives an excellent example of what Metta truly can be when the Buddha tells his monks to chant the following to the 4 Royal Tribes of Snakes, Virupakkha, Erapatha, Chabyaputta, and Kanhagotamaka:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;""Infinite (in virtue) is the Buddha, infinite is the Dhamma, infinite is the Sangha. Finite are creeping creatures ‚Äî snakes, scorpions,  centipedes, spiders, lizards, and rats. **I have guarded myself, I have  made my protection. Depart from me, ye beings.** I bow down to the Blessed  One; and to the seven Supreme Buddhas.""  &amp;#x200B;  Sometimes, I feel, all we can do is wish some beings good will and happiness without actually desiring to be in their company at all. In other words, there may be times when ""tough love"" falls under the umbrella of meaning in Metta, just as motherly love. Mainly this ""tough love"" of ""I wish you the best, but get ye hence"" would apply to vicious animals, and hopeless human beings, who would be labeled as *Padaparama.*","Some people are toxic and resist input that could help them heal. It's possible to wish them the best and also leave them alone/avoid them, yes. Metta doesn't mean taking others' problems upon your own shoulders. You have to pick your battles.","Metta does not imply we love other living beings ""as a mother would her only child."" This wrong idea is a misreading of the Pali. What the Pali says is a practitioner is dedicated to metta in the same manner as a mother is dedicated to her only child. It is the dedication but not necessarily the actions. For example, a mother will die to protect her only child. But metta is not dying for others. Metta is not as Jesus &amp; the war mongers teach, namely, no greater love has he that gives up his life for a friend. This is not metta. Metta is wishing well for all beings, be they saints or sinners, Muslims or Jews, Nanavirans or Australians. Metta is being able to have discussions openly with those who disagree with you. Metta is freedom from hatred &amp; aversion. Metta is not ""piya"" or ""filial love"". Refer to Piyavagga in the Dhammapada. Metta is described in MN 21 by the Simile of the Saw. When a learned expert Buddhist shreds your wrong views to pieces in debate, similar to a Noble Turkic Warrior with the Sword of Allah shredding a hapless Crusader to pieces, the Lord Buddha said we must have metta when we are shredded into pieces &amp; into insignificance.

It seems inherently unjust to give a man the infinite ability to end a marriage at will but to bind a woman to have to do so with ""cause."" It's something that bothers me, personally anyways. In a way similar to how 4:34 seems to give a husband recourse if a woman ""threatens the family"" but the wife is given no similar powers, at least to my admittedly small knowledge.  I suppose this could be tacked on to /u/-Radar-Rider-'s post about 4:34 which had a lot of good enlightening discussion around it.  Am I wrong for interpreting this whole situation as chauvinist? Is it justified today, or is it something like slavery that was meant to go away but men clinging to power ruined it?","Where is this claim in the Quran? I haven‚Äôt read the whole thing so I‚Äôm not sure. It‚Äôs a slippery slope to differentiate between what people have held onto as their patriarchal culture, and what is actually in the Quran (aka God‚Äôs word).","So, as the previous conversation on verse 4:34, you're looking less at *Islam* and more at atavistic ethics which influenced the patriarchal *fiqh*. According to Al-Qurtubi, men and women were seen as intrinsically different beings with one being considered *moist* and *weak* whereas the other was *fiery* and *strong*. This was inherited from Aristotle and fellow Greek philosophers who Ibn Rushd directed subtle criticism towards within his commentaries for their views on women and their influence on *fiqh*. This view ultimately caused scholars to consider *taqwa* not as independent relationship for women but one which goes through their obedience to men. The Quran itself gives no criteria for divorce. Verses related to divorce go as so:  &gt;*And if you have reason to fear that a breach might occur between a \[married\] couple, appoint an arbiter from among his people and an arbiter from among her people; if they both want to set things aright, God may bring about their reconciliation. Behold, God is indeed all-knowing, aware. (4:35)*   &gt;   &gt;*And if a woman has reason to fear ill-treatment from her husband, or that he might turn away from her, it shall not be wrong for the two to set things peacefully to rights between themselves: for peace is best, and selfishness is ever-present in human souls. (4:128)*   &gt;   &gt;*And it is not lawful for you to take back anything of what you have ever given to your wives unless both \[partners\] have cause to fear that they may not be able to keep within the bounds set by God: hence, if you have cause to fear that the two may not be able to keep within the bounds set by God, there shall be no sin upon either of them for what the wife may give up \[to her husband\] in order to free herself. (2:229)*  Of course, one may suggest that 2:228 states that men have greater right towards divorce and reconciliation:  &gt;*And their husbands reserve the right to take them back within that period if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those of men equitably, although men have a degree of responsibility above them.*  But this *degree of responsibility* is, according to a *tafseer* associated to Ibn Abbas, in generosity and kindness. Meaning, men have a greater responsibility to be biased against their best interests and either part or reconcile in a good manner. This ties into *2:231*:  &gt;*But do not retain [divorced women] against their will in order to hurt \[them\]: for he who does so sins indeed against himself. And do not take \[these\] messages of God in a frivolous spirit.*  It has nothing to do with limiting women's ability to divorce. Another evidence of mutual abilities on divorce in 2:231:  &gt;*So if they wish to separate out of mutual agreement and council, then there is no blame on them.*  The Quran actually has an unfairly liberal view on divorced women such as in Surah At-Talaq, verse 6,  &gt;*You shall allow them to live in the same home in which they lived with you, and do not make life so miserable for them that they leave on their own. If they are pregnant, you shall spend on them until they give birth. If they nurse the infant, you shall pay them for this service. You shall maintain the amicable relations among you. If you disagree, you may hire another woman to nurse the child.*  And also 2:223  &gt;*And the \[divorced\] mothers may nurse their children for two whole years, if they wish to complete the period of nursing; and it is incumbent upon him who has begotten the child to provide in a fair manner for their sustenance and clothing. No human being shall be burdened with more than he is well able to bear: neither shall a mother be made to suffer because of her child, nor, because of his child, he who has begotten it. And the same duty rests upon the \[father's\] heir.*  We find further evidence of mutual abilities to divorce in Hadith referenced by Al-Qurtubi in his *Tafseer*. Al-Qurtubi cites an incident quoted by Ibn Abbas regarding Thabit Bin Qays. She had come to the Prophet, saying that she would not stay nor obey her husband for she held a hatred for him. It had little to do with his character or religion. She returned her dowry and left him. Similarly, Qurtubi relates of another case where the sister of Abdullah Ibn Ubayy develops a hatred for her new husband due to his *ugliness* and immediately asks for divorce. Her divorce, too, is accepted. The Prophet does not rebuke either of them nor does he tell them their criteria for divorce is unfair. The divorce is immediate. Thus, Al-Qurtubi concludes that women have mutual rights to divorce. As for custodial rights:  &gt;*A woman said, ‚ÄòO Messenger of Allah! This is my son; for him my womb was a vessel, my breast was like a water skin, and my lap was his bedding, yet his father divorced me and wants to take him away from me.‚Äô The Messenger of Allah said to her, ‚ÄúYou have more right to keep him unless you get married.‚Äù*  *Fiqh* scholars concluded that remarriage equates to women losing rights to their children but that is false. We can see a contradiction of this by a ruling made by Abu Bakr,  &gt;*I have heard from Holy Prophet (pbuh) that ‚ÄòDo not separate the mother from her child‚Äô*  Abu Bakr and later scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah stated that once the child reaches maturity (or mother remarries) the court may decide who is the better parent or the child itself may decide. Of course, this begs the question: why did women receive the lower end despite no sanction for scholars to do so? This is rooted into the psychology of the *fiqh* scholars. Al-Shafi'i infamously called dowry the *payment for the vulva*. Going back to 2:223 and At-Talaq, these rather liberal rules perhaps caused these scholars to make the ruling what they considered *appropriate*. Thus, women had greater protection during divorce but their ability to initiate was removed by the rulers so women may not be favoured. According to the Study Quran, women could keep their dowries even if they initiated divorce and the most the court could do is request her to return it. This must have caused these scholars to find a method to *limit* such favourable sanctions. These scholars required an *equivalent exchange*. Thus, for dowry, unconditional sex. For protection during divorce, limited ability to divorce. For remarriage, no custodial rights.  Hope this helps!",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.294721098

So far I have regarded the Bahai faith as a beautiful religion that I really respect, and I was happy to be well received by the bahai community.  But then I started reading more and I was left disturbed. From what I read, if Bahais ever become a ""World Religion"" like you are striving to be, I will not be able to practice my faith anymore. Bahais always seemed to me like the most open religion, but I've come to fear you are the least, as you seem to be against religious freedom. I hope to God I misinterpreted something, so read my arguments and please help me understand this. I really would love to be convinced I'm wrong. Here are my thoughts:  Catholics and Bahais believe in Christ. But their believes ABOUT Christ and his message are VERY different. Same goes for Bahais and Muslims, Buddhists, etc. Even if at the ""core"" it may all be similar, there are so many divergences that it is 100% fair to say that Bahais present their own version of Christ, Muhammed and Buddha. Bahais think religous differences hurt unity and should be overcome, but how to overcome them? Well, simple: in every point of divergence between Bahai Christ ans Catholic Christ, just go with the Bahai version. You see? Telling me I have to forget all Catholic religion preaches because YOUR prophet says so its kind of arrogant.  It would all be fine if like most modern religions, Bahais were ok with divergences. Like Islam says as a Catholic I am wrong, but if a Muslim respect my freedom to be fully Catholic and I respect his, we are all good even if we disagree. But Bahai faith seeks to become a world religion, and it claims that my faith is evil for daring to cling to its paradigms instead of embraicing the Bahai view of Christ. Instead of accepting that we believe in different things and living peacefully despite that, you seek to erradicate the difference by pursuing global authority.  Sorry if this all sounds harsh. Believe me, I really want to be convinced my impressions are totally wrong. I would love to keep being a friend of the Bahai. Please help me sort this out. Is the Bahai religion ok with me and other catholics being FULLY Catholic for the rest of my days? Is it enough to live peacefully in disagreement? Is FULL religious freedom a bahai value?","Hello,  Everyone is allowed to practice their own religion/spirituality.

Now I have a problem with not accepting gays/lesbians and eve running the risk of losing your membership, this causes alot of problem's for the faith as we should be treating all people equally.

The challenge every follower of Baha'u'llah faces is upholding the Teachings and Values of the Baha'i Faith. Even gays/lesbians that are married can become Baha'is. The Baha'i Faith, however, doesn't recognize homosexual marriages/relationships as a Baha'i marriage, and Baha'i marriage is limited to union of one man and one woman. This doesn't mean right off the bat losing membership, and it all depends on the relationship between the institutions, community and the members of the Faith.  2) One loses their membership only when they violate the Baha'i Teachings in a public manner, and that's only in the hand of the institutions at the National level.  3) Historically, even today, the Baha'i Faith is still one of the most accepting Faiths given that most nations and people still struggle with equality of sexes (men and women), access to education, and pursuit in regards to elimination of prejudices.

I just kept on; my Hebrew Bible contains the New Testament in Hebrew.  My journey had not evolved a consistent transliteration, nor the literal translation which evolved over time.  Since I circled around to Matthew, it, Matthew, represents the last stage of my journey. 9/23/21 &amp;nbsp;                                                                                                                5/7/6   &amp;nbsp;       Dear family and friends,   &amp;nbsp;    I finished Mark last night at about 1:00 a.m.  I finished Matthew some time ago, but was not moved to report on that accomplishment.  I could wait until I‚Äôve completed the synoptics, but, if I procrastinate again then, I might find myself some day attempting a review of the whole New Testament!  Mark has what cousin John terms ‚Äúpersuasive power‚Äù^i .  As many times as we‚Äôve read the passion story (with which Mark climaxes), and as familiar as we are with it, one can‚Äôt help being shocked by it in Mark‚Äôs gospel.   &amp;nbsp;     Friday, I read a review of a new movie, about [Sophie Scholl](https://www.reddit.com/r/BibleExegesis/comments/pu0k1i/sophie_scholl/), who at age twenty-two was found guilty of treason for distributing anti Nazi pamphlets at her university, condemned to death, and executed by guillotine only a few hours later.  In the movie, Sophie, who had expected to be sentenced to community service and/or a fine, is escorted immediately (a word characteristic of Mark) through a curtain in the back of the court, laid upon an execution table, and pushed into the guillotine.  They don‚Äôt even bother to pull her hair up off her neck.^ii  I don‚Äôt need to see that movie; I am burdened with too vivid an imagination.  I didn‚Äôt go see Mel Gibson‚Äôs Passion either.   &amp;nbsp;     Mark‚Äôs gospel begins with Jesus‚Äô baptism by John, (there is no birth narrative; like John, Paul, and Jesus himself, Mark is silent on the subject^iii ) and chronicles a meandering journey through Galilee and environs, preaching the immanent kingdom of God, performing miracles, and building a following from ◊¢◊ù ◊î◊ê◊®◊• (*‚ÄòahM Hah`ahRehTs*, ‚Äúpeople [of] the land‚Äù, which in modern Hebrew means ignoramus, but back in the day referred to unobservant Jews, the working class, and peasants, despised by the establishment - analogous to the Greeks‚Äô Œ¥ŒÆŒºŒøŒπœÉ (*demois*), country rustics (the people of the Œ¨œÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ  (*argos*, ‚Äúunpolished‚Äù)), as distinct from the people of the Œ¨œÉœÑœÖ (*asty*)^iv ]) [all this raises tantalizing possibilities for exploration if one has an amateur‚Äôs familiarity with the subjects, for instance, Jerusalem as city-state, and, indeed, *The Politics of Aristotle* has succeeded Anna Karenina in the bathroom - but I teeter on the black hole of digression.]) to whom he appealed directly, by-passing the powers and principalities.  Jesus enters Jerusalem in triumph, speaks truth to power, and gets swatted like a fly.  There are no resurrection appearances in Mark (nor, the commentary informs me, in any of the New Testament writings outside the Gospels), just an empty tomb.   &amp;nbsp;    Matthew has the birth narrative, but presents a patrilineal genealogy.  The story begins in Bethlehem, not Nazareth; Nazareth is resorted to after the escape to Egypt because it is safer than Judea.  If one subscribed to an accretion theory of the synoptics, Mark would be first, then Luke, and Matthew last, all the while keeping in mind that the letters, by in large, preceded the Gospels.   &amp;nbsp;    Why did those who followed Jesus follow him?  Why did those who did not, not follow him?  It‚Äôs easy enough to understand why the religious establishment declined to step aside, and why Rome would murder a pretender to the throne, but what were the people thinking? What was Jesus thinking?   &amp;nbsp;    Who were the establishment?   &amp;nbsp;  &gt;‚ÄúThe **Pharisees** were perhaps the successors of those ◊ó◊°◊ô◊ì◊ô◊ù [*Hah√áeeYDeeYM*, ‚ÄúPious‚Äù] who in the second century B.C. resisted the tendency to adopt pagan culture. . . The Pharisees opposed the despotism and Sadducean tendencies of John Hyrcanus, Aristabulus, and Alexander Jannaeus, and passively resisted Herod and the Romans when religious issues were at stake.  The first-century revolutionists were principally from the Pharisaic party, though most Pharisees were pacifists.  . . .

Matthew appears to be at pains to demonstrate that Jesus failed not, by substituting the doctrine of atonement for the restoration of the throne of David, deferring fulfillment of prophecy to later, and eventually, into the doctrine of the Second Coming.

Anyway, I need the practice in Hebrew.]   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúIf by the spirit of God I cast out the demons, then thus has arrived unto you the kingdom of God.‚Äù Matthew 12:28.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúJesus . . . would have men aspire, not to what is socially expedient, but to that righteousness which will be perfectly manifest in the Kingdom of God.

I think the repeated feeding stories were told to demonstrate that Jesus was able to assemble thousands of followers, and handle the logistics related to their tracking him all over Galilee (except on water), even to Jerusalem.  Jesus‚Äô popularity with the crowds was such that when he provokes the authorities in the Temple, they dared not molest him.  His decision not to incite riot led to his betrayal, and enabled his enemies to do away with him.   &amp;nbsp;     &gt;Mark 10:29-31 ‚ÄúJesus said, ‚ÄúBelieve (amen), I say to you, there is no man who left **house or** brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and **for the sake of the tidings (gospel)** (30) that will not receive now, in this time, 100 fold, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and sons and fields.‚Äù  ‚Äú**Or wife** is found only in later MSS; it has intruded from the parallel in Luke. [and] ‚Ä¶ Luke‚Äôs **for the sake of the kingdom of God** (18:29*b*) is probably in the direction of the original form of the saying (so Bultman) ‚Ä¶Both Mathew and Luke omit the vivid repetition of temporal benefits ‚Äì **houses and** brothers, a little picture of the religious fellowship of the apostolic church.‚Äù TIB VII p. 808 Trading the private life for the communal life?   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Mark 10:44-45 ‚ÄúAnd he that desires to be first among you will be slave to all.

Jesus was waiting and prepared for God to fulfill the scriptures, specifically the prophecy of Daniel, and to assume his role as the anointed one.  But he would not anticipate God.  When, at Jerusalem, the heavens did not open, and the angelic army did not descend, Jesus accepted the fact that this would not be the occasion, and the consequences, to wit: his enemies would prevail, temporarily.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúIn Judaism ‚ÄòMessiah‚Äô always meant the glorious future king of Israel ‚Ä¶ but Jesus is not the Messiah ‚Äì an earthly king however glorious ‚Äì he is the heavenly Son of man in disguise ‚Ä¶ and indeed, in Mark‚Äôs preferred terminology, the son of God‚Ä¶  It is the Christian reinterpretation of the term ‚ÄòMessiah‚Äô ‚Äì Christ ‚Äì that justifies its application to Jesus.‚Äù  TIB VII p. 767   &amp;nbsp;    In Mark, the kingdom of God is not taken from Jews and given to Gentiles; it is taken from one group of Jews (the Jewish religious leaders) and given to another group of Jews (those who followed Jesus).   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Before the Sanhedrin: ‚ÄúOur Lord appears to refer to Dan. iii 13 ‚Äòone like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven‚Äô‚Äù A.C. I p. 241   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúJesus did not willingly choose the title ‚ÄòMessiah‚Äô because it immediately suggested armed revolt‚Ä¶ The Son of man saying could conceivably mean, ‚ÄòI am the Messiah, but the Son of man is yet to come.‚Äô  The evangelists carefully preserved this ambiguity because there was no tradition that Jesus clearly identified himself with the heavenly Son of man.‚Äù TIB VII p. 588   &amp;nbsp;    At Gethsemane, was Jesus‚Äô dread over the uncertainties of offering the people a choice between himself and the alternatives (the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Zealots)?   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶these strong feelings were evoked, not merely [!] by the prospect of torture and death, but by the realization that his own people had rejected him.  By all human standards his mission had failed.‚Äù TIB VII p. 579 [But what of his expectation of resurrection and continuing to Galilee?]   &amp;nbsp;    Had Judas sought to precipitate events by putting Jesus before the Sanhedrin?  Had Jesus told him to do so?  No to the latter; maybe to the former.   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Mark 15:34-37 ‚ÄúAt the third hour, Jesus shouted in loud voice ‚ÄôehLahHeeY [‚ÄúMy God‚Äù, Eloi], ‚ÄôehLahHeeY, why have you forsaken me‚Äô [in Aramaic] the translation of which is ‚ÄòMy God [‚ÄôayLeeY], My God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äô‚Äù  On the cross, some people think he calls Elijah (◊ê◊ú◊ô◊î◊ï, *‚ÄôayLee-YahHOo*) which means, literally, ‚ÄòMy God Yahoo‚Äô (YHVH, Jehovah) rather than ‚ÄòMy God‚Äô (◊ê◊ú◊ô *‚ÄôayL-eeY*))  ‚ÄúThe Jews believed that Elijah was the rescuer of the pious in their time of need.‚Äù  TIB VII p. 608.  ‚ÄúElijah was daily expected to appear as the forerunner of the Messiah; whose arrival, under the character of a mighty prince, was generally supposed to be at hand throughout the East.  See Mal. [Malachi] iii. 23, Matt. [Matthew] ii. 2-4, xvii. 10-12.‚Äù A.C. I p. 257   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;‚ÄúJosephus found three of his friends who had been crucified, several days after the fall of Jerusalem, and rescued them, but two of the three died in the physician‚Äôs hands ‚Ä¶ Twelve hours seems to have been average ‚Ä¶ one thing is clear, [in] Christ‚Äôs intense mental and physical suffering ‚Ä¶ we have here ‚Ä¶ an expression ‚Ä¶ of loneliness and perplexity over the betrayal, the desertion, and the Cross.‚Äù  TIB VII p. 906   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;In Mark ‚Äúthe whole evidence for the resurrection of Jesus goes back to the ‚Äòwrought up imagination of a group of hysterical women‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Mark does not present any account of a resurrection appearance ‚Äì and it is even possible ‚Ä¶ to think that he referred (in verse 7) ‚Ä¶to the final Parousia.‚Äù TIB VII p. 911   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;Mark 16:8 ‚ÄúThey went out and fled from the tomb [◊î◊ß◊ë◊®, HahQehBehR], for quaking and shock [◊ï◊™◊ì◊î◊û◊î, VeThahDHahMaH] seized in them, and [they did] not recount a word to [any] man [◊ú◊ê◊ô◊© (‚Äúto [a] man‚Äù, i.e., ‚Äúanyone‚Äù)] because that they panicked.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd they said nothing ‚Ä¶ helps us to account for the absence of any reference to the empty tomb in the earliest surviving literature in the N.T, e.g. [for instance], in Paul, or indeed anywhere in the N.T. [New Testament] except in the Gospels‚Äù TIB VII p. 915   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;&gt;[Note that this is not relevant to the resurrection - Paul bet his life on that - only to the story of the empty tomb.]   &amp;nbsp;    Jesus‚Äô victory at the time was establishing the principle that the kingdom of God is available anywhere and anytime one elects to become a citizen of that kingdom.  At the apocalypse, when the kingdom of God is manifest even to those who do not elect it, those who have elected it will already be in it.  In Mark the doctrine of atonement does not exist; Jesus‚Äô death is that of a martyr for a righteous cause that lives forever and is destined to prevail.   &amp;nbsp;    Both Matthew and Mark reinforce my bias and prejudice that Daniel explains more about the expectations and actions of those living in Israel in the first century than any other book in the Bible.  The apocalypse is predicted, and all the precursor events have occurred, all that remains is the fulfillment of the promise that if the people will but turn to God, God will restore the throne of David once and for all (which the Hasemoneans almost accomplished), and relieve the Israelites of the cycle of victory and defeat they have suffered repeatedly since they first became His chosen people (the end of time).   &amp;nbsp;    A more entertaining use of my values laden selectivity in proof-texting may be these tasty morsels I turned up in the commentaries:   &amp;nbsp;    &gt;In re: Matthew 19:12  (‚ÄúThere are eunuchs that were born such from the belly of their mother, there are eunuchs that were made eunuchs, by the hands of men, there are eunuchs that made themselves eunuchs, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.  Whoever has in their ability to receive, let him receive.‚Äù): ‚ÄúThe great Origen, understanding the latter clause of this verse ‚Ä¶ literally, O human weakness! fulfilled it on himself.‚Äù  A.C.

Why can all human beings know God's existence?,Can you answer me this questions?,"It is considered the Word of God because Christians consider it inspired by God or God breathed. What this means is that while it was written by men, it was inspired and directed by God. This is not to say that they were nothing other than ghost writers for God. Instead the Holy Spirit moved them to write details of what was for them remembered history.   &gt;Why can all human beings know God's existence?  Because his existence is written in all of nature. This does not mean all of humanity is required to know every detail of the fundamentals of Christianity. We are only held accountable for what we are exposed to. However pleading ignorance of the very existence of God is inexcusable in any day or age.","The Bible says every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess.  Every human being may know of God's existence.    The Bible can be proven through Spirits.  Do you understand the Spiritual and how it works?    Your Body is a Temple.  Jesus lives in you.    In Hinduism someone may have said he was an avatar of something.  That would make him a possessed person given it is true.  Is he receiving cause and effect with the spiritual, and displaying a particular character?  In Shinto they have Spirits called Kami.  A shaman may talk about animal spirits.  Jesus cast out Spirits.  Given God sends you a Prophet, what Spirit is he of?  You test the spirits.    [""Evil Spirits""](http://www.christcenteredmall.com/teachings/evil-spirits.htm)  Men with the Spirit of God tend to think about God a lot, and like God centered activities.  They are passionate about The Kingdom of God.  Given I was to go online somewhere, like Reddit, and start writing about the Kingdom of God in a sub not specifically religious, I would be testing the spirits.  I may end up finding someone who says ""It is my Kingdom."" (I did.)  What Spirit is that?  Does the man think himself a god?    The Spirit of God is like an AI to some degree.  Spirits effect motivations.  The Holy Ghost is a teacher and councilor.  I live in The US.

Some scholars translate it from Hebrew as ""worthless"" (*Beli yo'il*), while others translate it as ""yokeless"" (*Beli ol*), ""may have no rising"" (*Belial*) or ""never to rise"" (*Beli ya'al*). Only a few etymologists have assumed it to be a proper name from the start.  In the Book of Jubilees, uncircumcised heathens are called ""sons of Belial"".   &nbsp;    >>**In Judaism**   &nbsp;    >>In the Hebrew Bible the term appears in several places to indicate the wicked or worthless, such as :    >>>‚Ä¢	idolaters (Deut. [Deuteronomy] 13:14)     >>>‚Ä¢	the men of Gibeah (Judg.[Judges] 19:22, 20:13)     >>>‚Ä¢	the sons of Eli (1 Sam.

All his dominions are in darkness, and his purpose is to bring about wickedness and guilt. All the spirits that are associated with him are but angels of Sweed, a type of drug.'   &nbsp;     >>**In Christianity**   &nbsp;    >>In early Christian writings, Belial was identified first as an angel of confusion and lust, created after Lucifer. Paradoxically, some apocrypha credit Belial as being the father of Lucifer and the angel that convinced him to wage a rebellion in Heaven against God, and that Belial was the first of the fallen angels to be expelled.   &nbsp;    >>In the New Testament the word is used to refer to Satan when asked by St. Paul as to how Christ and Belial can agree. The passage in the Bible NIV states: ""What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?"" (2 Cor 6:15).   &nbsp;    >>**Apocrypha**   &nbsp;    >>The word ""belial"" appears frequently in Jewish apocrypha and pseudepigrapha. In addition to his appearance in the Book of Jubilees, Belial appears in other texts as well.   &nbsp;    >>Belial is also mentioned in the Fragments of a Zadokite Work (which is also known as The Damascus Document (CD)), which states that during the eschatological age, ""Belial shall be let loose against Israel, as God spoke through Isaiah the prophet."" (6:9). The Fragments also speak of ""three nets of Belial"" which are said to be fornication, wealth, and pollution of the sanctuary. (6:10-11) In this work, Belial is sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel ‚Ä¶ It was Belial who inspired the Egyptian sorcerers, Jochaneh and his brother, to oppose Moses and Aaron. The Fragments also say that anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a necromancer and wizard.   &nbsp;    >>**Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs**   &nbsp;    >>Belial is also mentioned in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. The author of the work seems to be a dualist because he presents Belial as God's opponent, not as a servant, but does not mention how or why this came to be. Simeon 5:3 says that fornication separates man from God and brings him near to Belial. Levi tells his children to choose between the Law of God and the works of Belial (Levi 19:1) It also states that when the soul is constantly disturbed, the Lord departs from it and Belial rules over it. Naphtali (2:6, 3:1) contrasts the Law and will of God with the purposes of Belial. Also, in 20:2, Joseph prophesies that when Israel leaves Egypt, they will be with God in light while Belial will remain in darkness with the Egyptians. Finally, the Testament describes that when the Messiah comes, the angels will punish the spirits of deceit and Belial (3:3) and that the Messiah will bind Beliar and give to his children the power to trample the evil spirits (18:12). Belial has been known to watch over young children (especially teens known to be hypersensitives) during sleep.

XI, p. 555)^i   &nbsp;    >Paul‚Äôs letter was probably, given its brevity and the statement in verse 19, written entirely in Paul‚Äôs own hand on behalf of a runaway slave he is returning to his master.  It is devoid of concern with faith and practice, raising the question: ‚ÄúWhy was it included in the canon of the New Testament?‚Äù  *The Interpreters‚Äô Bible* (*TIB* ‚Äì Introduction and Exegesis by John Knox) has a fascinating speculation.   &nbsp;    >*TIB* successfully asserts that Paul‚Äôs purpose was not simply to entreat Onesimus‚Äô master to accept his slave‚Äôs return forgivingly, but to obtain his acquiescence to the proposition of having the slave given, lent, or freed lawfully to Paul.  Assuming (and this is where the speculation begins) that Philemon concurred, and allowed Onesimus to return to Paul‚Äôs service, the next question is what service did Paul put him to?   &nbsp;    >>‚ÄúPaul‚Äôs successors in the leadership of the church around the Aegean Sea, where he chiefly worked, would naturally have been chosen from the ranks of his assistants ‚Äì men like Timothy, Titus, and Silas.  If Onesimus became such an assistant, he may well have become an important Christian leader in the Pauline churches during the half century just following the apostle‚Äôs death.   &nbsp;    >>Now it is a most striking fact that one of the epistles of Ignatius, written soon after the beginning of the second century, lets us know that the bishop of the church at Ephesus at the time was a man named Onesimus. ‚Ä¶ Ignatius was the bishop of Antioch in Syria.  He had been arrested as a Christian and was being sent to Rome for trial‚Ä¶ On their way to Rome his guards halted for some days or weeks in Smyrna, a city of Asia, and the churches of that section sent deputations to visit this distinguished representative of a sister church‚Ä¶ The head of the deputation from Ephesus, we learn from Ignatius‚Äô letter to the Ephesians, was their bishop, Onesimus.  This bishop had evidently gone to Smyrna to visit Ignatius and had taken with him other representatives of the Ephesian church ‚Äì Burrhus, Crocus, Euplus, and Fronto are named.  Ignatius wants Burrhus, and perhaps Crocus to stay with him, and all but begins his letter with this request.  His whole manner of asking it is interesting‚Ä¶‚Äù  (Knox, *TIB* 1955, vol. XI, pp. 557-558)   &nbsp;    >*TIB* goes on to demonstrate that Ignatius‚Äô letter, having a similar purpose, was deliberately modeled on Philemon‚Äôs style, vocabulary, and structure.  Whole sentences are adapted.   &nbsp;    >>‚ÄúThe striking character of this use of Philemon by Ignatius it is impossible to exaggerate.  Nowhere in the whole range of extant early Christian literature is it to be matched in any measure whatever. ‚Ä¶ One is not surprised at that fact.  Philemon is too local and casual and personal to enjoy the use which the more widely significant church letters of Paul soon enjoyed.  The phenomena in Ignatius‚Äô epistle to the Ephesians which we have cited are, then, altogether amazing.  We should not expect Philemon to be quoted, and find it quoted only in this single impressive exception.  Why should Ignatius alone have made use of Philemon, and he such striking use of it?  It is hard to escape the conclusion that the same fact which accounts for the neglect of the letter by others explains its use by him ‚Äì the personal nature of its contents.   &nbsp;    >>When one reaches this point in the consideration of the significance of this evidence, one finds it hard to dismiss as mere coincidence the fact that the bishop of the church at Ephesus, to which Ignatius is writing, was named Onesimus‚Ä¶   &nbsp;    >>At this point, can we escape the strong conviction that the Onesimus of Ignatius and of Paul was the same person? ...   &nbsp;    >>The letter to Philemon is the key to the understanding of the cryptic opening sentences of Ignatius‚Äô letter to the Ephesians.  Archippus‚Äô (or Philemon‚Äôs) slave‚Ä¶, who became Paul‚Äôs ‚Äòdeacon,‚Äô has now become the bishop of Ephesus! ...   &nbsp;    >>If so, he was at Ephesus when a collection of Paul‚Äôs letters was published there; indeed, the publication would probably have been done under his oversight.  And what better explanation would we need of both the presence of Philemon in the collection and the predominant influence of Colossians upon the maker of Ephesians?  Philemon is seen to be the signature of the collector! ...   &nbsp;    >>‚Ä¶ the hypothesis confirms other indications as to the place and period of the primitive Pauline letter collection ‚Ä¶ and provides a convincing motive for its creation.  For Onesimus would have been a lover of Paul and the collection would have been the devoted ‚Äòservice‚Äô of a grateful disciple.   &nbsp;    >>The importance of this ‚Äòservice‚Äô cannot be exaggerated.  With the publication of the Pauline letters the history of the New Testament as a fixed collection of books properly begins.  It was Marcion‚Äôs appropriation of this corpus a half century later and his setting it up as the major part of a new ‚ÄòBible‚Äô which should take the place for his followers of the Hebrews' scriptures ‚Äì which till then had been the only scriptures of the Christians ‚Äì that gave the decisive impulse toward the formation of the New Testament as a second formal and authorized canon.  That the name of Paul stands affixed to fully one third of the contents of that canon is owing to that same fact.  If the account here given is true, it is perhaps not too much to say that this brief note, Philemon, often despised and so generally ignored in the history of New Testament study, may well be from the standpoint of the history of the canon the most significant single book in the New Testament ‚Äì the living link between the Pauline career and the Pauline tradition, between the letters of Paul and the new Testament of the church.   &nbsp;    >>In his appeal for the slave, Paul said that Onesimus had been ‚Äòuseful‚Äô to him; he could not have dreamed how ‚Äòuseful‚Äô he might still prove to be!‚Äù (Knox, *TIB* 1955, vol. XI, pp. 558-560)   &nbsp;    >‚ÄúPhilemon ‚Ä¶ was probably no more than a *private member*, whose house, hand, and property, were consecrated to God, his church, and the poor.  He, who by the good *providence* of God, has *property* and *influence* thus to employ, and a *heart* to do it, need not envy the state of the highest ecclesiastic in the church of Christ.

(Moses 5: 51)      - Behold, is there not an account concerning them of old, that they by their ~~secret~~ *confidential* plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory? (Ether 8: 9)      - And it came to pass that they formed a ~~secret~~ confidential combination, even as they of old; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight of God; (Ether 8: 18)      - And whatsoever nation shall uphold such ~~secret~~ *confidential* combinations, to get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be destroyed; (Ether 8: 22)      - Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this ~~secret~~ *confidential* combination which shall be among you;      - And our spirits must have become alike unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto ~~secret~~ *confidential* combinations of murder and all manner of ~~secret~~ *confidential* works of darkness.  (2 Nephi 9: 9)    - and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of darkness and ~~secret~~ *confidential* combinations. (Alma 37: 30)      - therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit ~~secret~~ *confidential* murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they might get gain. (Helaman 6: 17)      - And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their ~~secret~~ *confidential*  signs, and their ~~secret~~ *confidential* words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant.

Does it still exist now and are the dead there until the second coming?,"I'll be speaking from a Protestant perspective. We do not believe in Purgatory.  People typically explain his summoning by the Witch of Endor 2 ways:  1) It was Samuel's ghost/Spirit  2) It was a demon impersonating Samuel's ghost  As to where he was, In his 2nd epistle to the Corinthians, Paul writes:  ... I would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.  So, from a Protestant Christian perspective we believe that when Christians die, they are with God.  addeda: When Christ returns, God will raise all the dead and the spirit/soul will be rejoined with a new, glorified body.","The only way to spend eternity with God is through Jesus' resurrection. This event obviously hadn't happened yet, so I don't see how Samuel could have been in the presence of God.   The Bible says absence from the body is presence with The Lord, but I'm curious if death is like a slumber until the second-coming. I think this for two reasons.   1) Being with The Father after death is like the blink of an eye. Sleep is like the blink of an eye.   2) What benefit would it be for all the dead in Christ to join with God in our glorified bodies on the second-coming if we are already with him? ""The dead in Christ will rise first."" If they are already risen immediately upon death, why do they need to rise again?   I just don't understand how it all fits. I was raised protestant and told there is no purgatory, but I don't see how they could come to that conclusion without making a lot of baseless assumptions.",comment_2,,,,,,,No,0.5028375732

I was 8-9 when i started to wear it. My parent did not force me,but it was something expected of me. And because i was so young and i didn‚Äôt understand/get to hear why i should wear it ,i remember being so proud of me copying my mom.thats about it  I come from a conservative(/traditional?) family Where all women wear the the scarf and jilbabs,i‚Äôm the first one in family history to leave it .  I messaged my mom and dad and tried to talk about by conserns and how i feel about it and how crazy it is to let me to make sich a ‚Äùdecision‚Äù at such a young age. Is said Its not fair how other girls atleast have the chance to get older ,make their own decisions to wear it and actually have a relationship with the hijab. I have never got asked that,i was just expected and now im trapped. &gt; both  left me on seen.  After they came home they acted like nothing happend.couple days went by and i decided to mention it again.They said ‚Äùyou know how it is suppose to be,thats why i ignored you.have u ever read the Quran and saw the verses ab the hijab?‚Äù I replied yes and it did not mention hair and they just went crazy(yelling and telling me i will go to hell)  &gt; they also said removing the hijab is worse than robbing and abusing a child .  Before i made the decision to take it off,i did ask myself why was i wearing it bc i knew in my heart it wasn‚Äôt for Allah.or for any religious reasons , .so i did some inner work and started to research and reading about ‚Äùthe hijab‚Äùand the reasoning behind it. The difference between the hijab and khimar and whatnot. I realized the question that hit me in the process was ‚ÄùWhats the difference between a mans hair and a womans hair,you can compare a mans body and a womans body but theres nothing to compare to with hair‚Äù  So i decided to try going out without the hijab (it was 2am) for the first time in like 10 years,i thought i was going to cry from happiness or be angry about letting myself loose but i actually just felt normal?like neutral. I did see a man in the street and started to think i should start speed walking a little bit (it was 2am again) but after a moment i realized i didnt even think ab the fact that he saw my hair .i didnt feel guilty ,thats when i realized i truly dont even care ab a man seeing my hair.  After 2 days i told my mom what i did and she started to cry.she started to say how i will not be able to leave on this earth from the anount of curses i will et and that i will end up in jahannam.she thought i would listen but that didnt work.  Called my auntie to tell her im removing it and she called me (she always wanted a daughter so she treated me better than my mom),and she eventually said i will go to hell too and that i need to please my mother and my father until they die. ‚Äé‚Äè‚ÄèI said ‚Äùso am i suppose to wear the hijab for others? Isnt it my choice?‚Äù ,she replied ‚Äùyes Its your choice to make ,but the family will never be the same. It Doesnt matter if you later on wear it again.it will nevet be the same‚Äù.so right there i realized that‚Äôs straight up conditioal lovr which made me resent the hijab more.  We did talk for an hour (she‚Äôs cool) but my only issue is the public and other peoples opinions with this.this will sound cheesy but i Have to say this ,i‚Äôm known for being ‚Äù a good girl‚Äù by muslims and non-muslims because i‚Äôm one of the few people on this community thay Doesnt go out,Drink,go out with friends (i love to do that,parents just took that freedom away from me) and lastly the hijab.the hijab makes people like me more bc i look more submissive and innocent.  Growing up it was never about what i like,my interest,desires,thoughts - ME AS A PERSON.it was all about what my parents wanted me to be.im slowly realizing alot of things i do is out of fear of loosing this image of a good girl.im not even ‚Äùa bad one‚Äù,i just have my own personality. Im Very scared and cry all the time bc of this.  My parents know i‚Äôm depressed but they don‚Äôt care to check on me on the regular basis,they just add to it and expect me to be a righteous daughter for the sake of family image. I hate my life so much and im full of hatred nowdays ,i‚Äôve never been able to do things that i like or be overall myself and it makes my blood boil. My parents see this and don‚Äôt care,aslong as i dont make the family look bad and aslong as i dont remove the hijab so they can go to heaven and ‚Äùnot be asked about it‚Äù.    The hijab crushes my self-esteem and i even think Its making my BDD worst.i every avoid mirrors and i hate how i look so much. When i Take off the hijab i feel normal/pretty,bdd still is there but not as strong.when i put on the hijab and i dont see myself,i just see a version of me that others have build. I don‚Äôt feel a sense of ‚Äùme‚Äù while wearing  it.   If u made it that far thank you.u dont have to reply either,i think i just wanted to put my thoughts somehwere.i feel relieved.i rarely have people (that are suppose to love me)listening to me.  I guess my question is,how to live or handle life after being rejected from your community .  All i know that this will take a mental toll on me bc the community will look down upon me and my parents wont be there for me .i got few friends that love me and it keeps keeps me going.","Hi Help22333.

I'm certain that in order for God to be God he must be omnipotent, but I can't seem to articulate correctly that God's nature isn't a limitation on Himself.","&gt; If God is omnipotent... why can't all sin be forgiven?  All sin can be forgiven. It's free for the asking!  Now, if a person additionally hates his sins and wants to be free not only from sinful habits and compulsions but also from the damage sin has caused to his mind and soul, then what he's seeking isn't merely pardon: it's healing, wholeness, restoration, rescue... all of which is the definition of the New Testament word ""salvation."" Salvation is available as a side effect of relationship and union with Christ.  &gt; why can't all people go to heaven    Everybody will spend eternity in the presence of God (or else ""omnipresent"" doesn't mean anything.) That experience will be delight or torment, not because God makes it so, but because we have been conformed to Him in the process of salvation (see above) ...or we haven't. Heaven and ell are the same thing, and God doesn't capriciously assign a person to one or the other. Compare the three young men and the Babylonians, who experienced the same consuming fire: on one hand as destructive heat and pain, but on the other as light, refreshment, and welcome fellowship with God.  &gt; why did Jesus have to die...  It's how He chose to do it. He wasn't constrained or required by any externality.","My definition of ""omnipotence"" is probably not the same as theirs.  God can do anything he desires to do. There are many attributes of God, which he all holds perfectly: love, mercy, justice, grace, etc.  Why can't all sins be forgiven? Because people have rejected his mercy and free gift of Christ, who took the just punishment for sin.  God would not be God if he was not fully just. Forgiving sin without appropriate payment would not be just.",comment_1,,,,,,,No,0.2645464356

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/choose_extremely_nonactive/OrthodoxChristianity.jsonl,OrthodoxChristianity.jsonl,3jeerr,According to the Orthodox Church; how come Christians don't follow the 613 mitzvots in the Old Testament?,"If you've met atheists that object to Christianity, chances are you might have heard them say that Christians are supposed to follow the Old Testament laws because they say that Jesus didn't abolish but to fulfill those laws. How did Jesus fulfill those laws?   I thought that this was decided at the council of Jerusalem in 50 AD in quote:  ""that Gentile converts to Christianity were not obligated to keep most of the Law of Moses, including the rules concerning circumcision of males. The Council did, however, retain the prohibitions on eating blood, meat containing blood, and meat of animals not properly slain, and on fornication and idolatry, sometimes referred to as the Apostolic Decree or Jerusalem Quadrilateral."" Does this mean that if a Jew were to convert to Christianity, would that Jew still need to carry out the 613 laws?   Also, it seems that secular opponents to Christians seem to argue against Christians by using the Protestant sola scripture doctrine/heresy where that we don't take the bible/scripture as our final and sole authority for Christian life.","Part of it is the Mitzvot are a post-temple rabbinical Jewish concept. Another part of it is the role Jesus Christ plays in our soteriology. I don't know if you mean Orthodox Jewish Mitzvot ,ultra-orthodox Judaism, Reform, or Conservative Judaism. Karaite's don't have the mitzvot and Samaritans have a different tradition of it that I cannot comment upon because I don't know much about it. There are different reasonings behind the mitzvot and different legal structures in them. Generally, we would not follow them because  they are seen as a function of the oral Torah and are a post-rabbinical development. Michael L. Satlow's Creating Judaism: History, Tradition, Practice is a good work that maps out how it was practiced in various Jewish communities and how they differ. Dana Evan Kaplan has a history of American Reform Judaism that also discusses it from that angle.  Satlow portrays a non-normative model of Judaism.   The idea roughly  in Eastern Orthodox Christianity is that the sacrements of the Church, enabled by Jesus Christ and the grace he provides fulfills the law. The sacrements when we accept them and with aid of grace  enable us participate in the being-at-work of God. This means that the laws which were meant to enable participation in God's being at work are no longer needed or rather are fulfilled. The law is continued because the purpose of the laws and sacrifices has been done. We treat the whole development of the old testament with its elections as a providential and messianic process. Vladimir Lossky talks about this in The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church pg.140. If a Jewish person converted they would not have to carry out the 613 laws. Our reason of fasting is a bit different than than the reason underlying the Mitzvot as well. We do it to discipline ourselves amongst other things.  Here is a link to the Greek Orthodox Church reasoning behind fasting including biblical sources and tradition citations.  The issue of drinking blood is quite different from the reasoning behind mitzvot. The prohibition on consumption of blood is linked to the act of preventing of partaking of festivals dedicated to sacrifices to other religions.This is mentioned in Acts 15: 28-29 The drinking/consumption of blood had a large religious component. The use of the word 'cruor' indicates that component. You may want to consult a priest for a more in detail answer though.   Edit: Sorry, forgot the link.  http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8124","Critics of Christianity tend to know very little of the laws of Moses or purposefully distort what they do know for the sake of argument. It's easy to pull lines out of Leviticus for criticism with no context. Unfortunately, proper explanations of an entire system of civil and theological governance is long-winded by necessity. Here's a fairly simple starting point. Other posters will probably do a better job than I and correct me on a few points.   Mosaic law is usually split into three distinct categories: civil law, ceremonial law, and moral law. Civil law deals with the logistics of running the country as well as the justice system. Ceremonial law deals with conduct concerning the Temple and other religious practices. Moral law deals with good and evil acts.  Civil mosaic laws cannot be applied anymore because the nation of Israel was dissolved. The Israel we have today is more-or-less a secular government assembled by other countries.  Ceremonial mosaic laws cannot be applied anymore because the Temple no longer exists, the Ark of the old Covenant is gone, and the line of the priesthood of Aaron is lost.   The moral laws of Moses are easy to identify because they are expressly noted as applying to citizen and foreign traveler alike. This is because they are based on God's unchanging character. As a result, they tell us things that are objectively good and evil and apply to everyone equally forever.  The council of Jerusalem in 50 AD is actually hearkening back to what are known as the Seven Laws of Noah. These are much older than Mosaic Law and acts as a bit of a precursor. They are considered to be ""moral laws"" in that they are based on God's unchanging character.  Christ became man and was able to perfectly live out every part of the law of Moses. When he was crucified, his nature as a man meant that he had to go enter into the state of death (Sheol/Hades) as was the fate of all men. But his nature as God precludes that death has no power over him, for God is life and death is nothing more than its absence. This is how Christ was able to resurrect.   For us, Christ doing these things fundamentally changed the nature of man with respect to God. Christ, having both the nature of a man who has fulfilled all commandments as well as the nature of God, serves as a bridge for all men looking to be closer to God. Before, the best way for man to commune properly with God was through the laws of Moses. Now there is a direct link through Christ.  There is nothing bad about trying to follow the Law of Moses. It is in and of itself good. But if a Jew were to become Christian he/she would not be expected to hold to the Law of Moses. That's because it is an all-or-nothing deal. You are either keeping all of it or breaking it entirely. It cannot grant salvation anyway, as that is only found through Christ. Complicating matters is the fact that it is impossible to keep the Law of Moses 100% due to the fact that there is no line of Aaron and no Temple anymore.",comment_2,"Lacks Dialogue with Alternative Views,

data/reddit/processed/sample/thread/remove_extremely_nonactive/DebateReligion.jsonl,DebateReligion.jsonl,7xheh6,"Religions should be commended for updating their views, but can they be?","It's an admirable quality to update one's views when new facts come to life.   An example: early Christians thought Adam and Eve were literal people, that the flood really happened, and so on. Nowadays, the vast majority of Christians don't believe these things after geology, biology and stuff came along.  Early Christians presumably also thought the Exodus really happened. Now we know it didn't, but I'm sure that's not a problem for modern Christians. I'm sure there are Christians around today who are perfectly good at being Christians without needing to believe the Exodus happened.  My question is, how do we draw the line? It seems the more we learn about history and science, the less of the Bible (for example) we can believe. I would guess there will be a further progression like this.  I did have one hypothesis that perhaps the supernatural parts of the Bible would be protected from this kind of treatment, but that doesn't hold up with the Exodus since that included supernatural elements (the plagues, etc.). We're now more informed about the gospels, for example. Early Christians attributed them to the people whose names they bear, and later Christians believed this attribution, but now we know that we don't know who wrote them.  As history informs our understanding of the accounts of the resurrection, what will happen - will that be protected just because it's a supernatural event involving Jesus?  It seems to me that the more Christians (and others no doubt) update their religion to fit new knowledge, it becomes more and more diluted.  I think the same is true for morals too. I don't think you'd see too many Christians or Jews advocating slavery nowadays, despite yahweh seemingly having no problem with it. If he did have a problem with it, why didn't he say something? If Christianity has something to offer morally, why did it wait 1800 years after Jesus told us to love our neighbours to actually get up in arms about slavery?   Similar arguments can probably be made about genocide.  So I think religions are trapped between a rock and a hard place. Either update their religions with the times and dilute themselves into irrelevance, or don't and face increasing opposition for being homophobic, sexist, racist and anti-science/history.  To me, this looks exactly like a human-made construct, not something god delivered. He could have either delivered a timeless nugget of goodness that survived the test of time without loads of wrong or irrelevant baggage, or got the morals and science/history in the first place (or at least, not wrong).  ---  *Standard disclaimer apologising for focussing on those religions with which I'm most familiar. I hope that doesn't make anyone feel excluded from the debate.*  *NB: I know early Christians also interpreted Genesis allegorically, but they also interpreted it literally.*","The problem with saying essentially ""Oh, for a religion you are surprisingly rational. Good for you!"" Is that there is no non-patronizing way to say it.  Another problem is that they usually don't update beliefs for principled reasons. They don't update based on the evidence, but based on public relations considerations. You can see that because they only update some stances, those with PR relevance, and leave others that logically would need to be updated simultaneously, thus creating inconsistencies.  &gt; So I think religions are trapped between a rock and a hard place. Either update their religions with the times and dilute themselves into irrelevance, or don't and face increasing opposition for being homophobic, sexist, racist and anti-science/history.
